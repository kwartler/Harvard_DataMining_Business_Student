Hi Frank
Less to this than meets the eye. I just said that 2014 was a goal not a guarantee and that the Nato mission would continue thereafter, focused on training etc. But inevitably some of the more excitable journalists decided that I was predicting combat for years.

Mark,
I am travelling with Secretary Clinton and read a statement in the press attributed to you that characterized 2014 as an inflection point for transition to Afghan security forces lead, and that full transition could go beyond 2014. I had not heard that formulation before. I assume it was mis-reported, but wonder if you could clarify.
Much appreciated
