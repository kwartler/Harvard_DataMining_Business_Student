Subject: Syria - Discussion with JSR Brahimi

All - below is a conversation that Salman Ahmed had with Lakhdar Brahimi on Sunday. Ask that you
keep this closehold, given the frankness of his comments.

 His trip to the Syria and the region confirmed his assumption that conditions for a negotiated political settlement are not yet present; meanwhile, it remains to be seen that alternatives to a negotiated settlement can be induced or will materialize anytime soon:

 LB appreciates the conversations with Robert to date and looks forward to a lengthier, in-person brainstorm in NY, if their respective schedules allow in the next week.
 As concerns the bilat with S, LB said he was grateful she was able to make the time to see him. He looked forward to meeting her and intended to be as candid and honest as he could in answering any questions she had. He will be happy to share insights from his contacts to date with Syrian and external actors (e.g. Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, France, UK). But he will be reluctant to volunteer unsolicited opinions or information, as he does not want to come across as presumptuous.
 As concerns the UNSC session tomorrow, LB did not plan to go into.too much detail and naturally will stay clear of much of the above. 1.4(B) 1.4(D) B1
 LB is leaning towards being based in Cairo over the next few months but will defer to whatever the SG and his senior advisers decide makes sense politically and administratively.
