Jake--
I recognize that were most likely going to have a gap in the COM slot in Baghdad.
So I think that people whom the Iraqis recognize -- Tom Nides, me, Tony Blinken, etc. -- will have to increase the tempo of our travel to Baghdad for a time.
But if S is seeing Jim Jeffrey, I wonder if she could squeeze him to stay on for just a few more weeks. Not indefinitely, but, say, another month, say until May 1. There will always be bad issues in Iraq that need to be addressed, but the Syria/over flight issue seems particularly important. So I'm all in favor of minimizing the gap, even if we still end up with one. I think the only way Jim would agree to stay a few more weeks would be if the Secretary or President would ask.
