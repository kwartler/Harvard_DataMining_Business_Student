I am hearing it is a big problem if we 'scoop' muhtar instead of letting him tell the secretary himself.
Can we leave out coke (for Secretary's remarks) and hope that he will tell her in person so that she adds reference to coke herself? Yes, I recognize that is a "hail mary" alignment of the stars scenario.
As soon as I hear if/when he mentions it to someone at state, I'll let you know. Thank you!

I am not sure. If she does she will want to mention all of them. Is it a big problem?

Thanks, Carola! Could you please hold off on having the Secretary mention Coca-Cola in her luncheon remarks? I think Muhtar may want to tell her personally first. Is she mentioning the other corporate donors at lunch?

Yippee! This is great. The First Lady's press release already went out, but we will have it updated. I will try to get info to the Secretary for State Lunch remarks!

Carola, sorry for the late notice.1 just heard that Coca-Cola has approved a $1 million gift for the 100,000 Strong initiative, and Muhtar Kent or Clyde Tuggle will inform State of this decision at the lunch today or State dinner this evening. Would it be possible for coca-cola to be added to press about the initiative in conjunction with the visit? Thanks very much for working with us on this. all best, amy

Got it. We are sending back edits to the FLOTUS press release, but I am sure we can add an extra $1 million if Coke comes through by the end of the day! Thanks for your help.
