Dear Kurt and Derek,

1.4(D) B1

Background on Rohingya in Burma: Approximately 800,000 predominantly Muslim Rohingya live in northern Rakhine State near the Burma-Bangladesh border. Citing restrictive citizenship laws, Burma denies the Rohingya citizenship, rendering them stateless. The Rohingya experience severe legal, economic, and social discrimination. The government limits their ability to travel, marry, study and work. Perhaps as many as 1.5 million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. Clashes in June between Buddhist Rakhines and Muslim Rohingya left at least 78 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.

In response to press coverage of Thein Sein's remarks, a UNHCR spokeswoman said: "There are no
ground for us to set up refugee camps inside a country where they are supposed to be citizens."
Thanks in advance for your help! Anne

U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres told reporters Thursday it was not his agency's job. Myanmar denies citizenship to the Rohingya and considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Some have lived there generations. President Themn Sein's website said he told Guterres in a meeting Wednesday that the solution to ethnic enmity in Myanmar's western Rakhine state was to either send the Rohingya to a third country or have the UNHCR look after them.
