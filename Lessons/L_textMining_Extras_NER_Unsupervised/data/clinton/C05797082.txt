Subject: URGENT UPDATE /CAR

Madam Secretary, Events have been fast moving in the Central African Republic today after protestors, probably encouraged by the government, breached a wall of the French embassy and also protested outside of ours. Interagency conference calls, led by Johnnie, resulted in General Ham developing a conops to move as soon as tomorrow 1500 through an ordered departure. We anticipate having to move about 70 people including our 8 Embassy personnel and some minors. We just completed a conference call with Denis McDonough, General Ham, John Brennan, Johnnie, Robert Cardillo, Kathleen Hicks, Chris Wood, Avril Haines and others to review planning and decisions. Kathleen Austin-Ferguson from Pat's office joined as well. The following is agreed:

 Johnnie is speaking with Ambassador Wohlers now to work details to be ready for departure as early as 1500 tomorrow.
 Johnnie is also confirming that Amb. Wohlers has accepted French protection for two houses on residence compound and protection is in place.
 Kathleen has expedited paper work for ExecSec to go to DoD tonight and for Pat to sign ordered departure first thing in the morning.
 Diplomatic Security has reviewed plans with RSO for moving Amcits to airport (20 minutes from post) through multiple runs protected by French.
 General Ham has identified assets, is finalizing conops, and knows that if we can move people tomorrow vice original Friday early hours, tomorrow is strongly preferred.
 We have not yet told Amcits explicitly of ordered departure to protect their and embassy security though they have a heads up. Amb. Wohlers has a meeting tomorrow morning with Amcit leaders to talk through process. He has just told Johnnie that he thinks he can get everything done by 1500 but there is a great deal to do to manage all Amcits and all personnel including the FSNs who will maintain the embassy after we leave (only need 20 minutes to finish classified destruction).
 We are all committed to moving as expeditiously as possible while keeping everyone safe. We are hopeful that will be tomorrow at 1500 but no later than early morning Friday. The airport is 24 hour capable but General Ham says barely, making a landing and take-off at night less than optimal.

The rebels remain outside of Bangui. Press reports that they are somewhere between 45-60 miles out. The rebels have said that they are not yet moving on Bangui but it remains to be seen what will really happen. Johnnie has also been in close touch with his French counterpart and Fabius and Hollande are being briefed. The French do not intend to suspend their operations because there are too many French in CAR to be able to evacuate all. There will be an update
