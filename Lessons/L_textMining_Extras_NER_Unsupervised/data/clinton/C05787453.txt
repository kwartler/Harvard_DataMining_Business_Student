RELEASE IN PART B5

Thank you for giving this your most serious attention; you need a mature emissary with an expert translator to ensure full dialogue and that not one unnecessary life is lost or ordinance expended.
As you know, at this very moment there is a team assembled under our roof prepared to depart as needed, as am I, if the Secretary will privilege me to make this small contribution to her all embracing and effective efforts to realize the world for my children and grandchildren that my law professor friend Barack Obama spoke of one cold but clear January day, as the one that always comes first with open hand, not clenched fist.
God bless the America that remains our troubled world's best hope.
Doug Amb. Kmiec
