Colleagues,
The information below is a summary of the latest GLOC developments provided to the Watch by Embassy Islamabad. In short, seven containers are en route to the Torkham border, bringing the total number moved to eleven. Embassy Islamabad will meet with government officials July 13 at the Pakistani Ministry of Defense to finalize the MOU. PM Ashraf's instruction to move cleared U.S./ISAF/NATO cargo immediately is making its way to action officers to effect.

Ambassador Munter met with Prime Minister Ashraf, who was joined by Foreign Secretary Jilani, Defense Secretary Sethi, Ambassador Rehman, and MFA Additional Secretary Babar. They told him 1,579 pieces of U.S./ISAF/NATO cargo was to be released immediately. Embassy Islamabad received the attached diplomatic note, note applies to cargo that was cleared and issued No-objection Certificates (NOC) prior to the November 26, 2011 incident, within an hour of the meeting's completion. Ambassador Asif Durrani from the Presidency confirmed this with DCM Islamabad and added remaining cargo should be cleared by Ramadan (i.e., by July 20/21).
Post estimates the likely break-down of the cargo as: · 1,031 U.S. military cargo · 151 pieces of diplomatic cargo (awaiting confirmation) · Remainder should be ISAF/NATO cargo (post has asked ISAF to confirm)

77 containers of books for the Afghanistan Ministry of Education should also move immediately -- the paperwork for these containers is complete but awaits NLC scanning & inspection. Post relayed this information to the MFA, which said it would work on this cargo July 12. In addition, the Kajaki Dam containers should also move immediately. Ten need Customs to issue the "release authorization" to leave the port, after which they must be scanned. For the remaining five -- the clearing agent is Astro, but post has had virtually no contact with them or information about them. They are not a clearing agent used by DOD. Demurrage charges must be paid, and the process has started, but is not completed. Cargo movement: Four trucks (carrying seven containers) are en route July 12 to Afghanistan on the northern route and should cross the border at Torkham 18:00 local time. Based on information from local staff in Peshawar these containers were not scanned, but customs seals were checked and the containers were released. In addition, it appears that yesterday's message that customs-cleared, NOC-issued cargo should move immediately is making its way to action officers (at least at Torkham). These will bring the total number of containers moved to 11. However, no additional cargo has moved from Karachi as the Pakistani government puts the finishing touches on procedures for scanning and inspection. The MFA assured post that this written guidance is near-completion and might be issued before close-ofbusiness July 12. MOU: The MFA contacted post saying it wants to present the MOU to the cabinet immediately. DCM Islamabad spoke with Sohail Khan and Ubaid Nizamani (Director of the Americas) and told them that both sides should sit down together at least once more to make finalize the MOU and ensure both sides agree to its terms. Post offered a video-conference with the U.S.-based experts or in-person with an Embassy team. The MFA wants to meet July 13, in-person, at the Ministry of Defense (16:00 local time). Pakistani participants will likely include Defense Secretary Sethi, RADM Farrokh, and MFA representatives. Ambassador Briefed Coalition Partners about GLOC: The Ambassador, DCM, and ODRP Commander briefed Coalition partners about the GOP's July 3 decision to re-open the GLOC. They provided information about the GOP's July 11 interagency meeting that resulted in the decision to the cargo immediately and outlined the current status of the MOU. Coalition partners asked about the events prompting the GLOC re-opening, CSF disbursement timing, retrograde operations, measures to prevent another GLOC closure in the future, and GOP security provisions for cargo. All expressed their gratitude for the briefing and welcomed the openness.
