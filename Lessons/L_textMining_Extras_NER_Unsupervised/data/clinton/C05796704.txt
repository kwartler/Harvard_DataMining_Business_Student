For: Hillary From: Sid Re: Petraeus/October Surprise
My operative theory on Petraeus scandal is that it became an October Surprise that failed. Forcing the scandal public and his resignation would have been the trifecta--leaks, Benghazi, then Petraeus--allowing Romney to argue that Obama had created a national security collapse. It would have overtaken the end of the campaign. My thought is that Leahy should be in this now and that Feinstein should be made aware, if she is not already, of the October Surprise scenario.
Some questions: Are there agents and other employees at FBI in regular contact with Republican members of the House outside the regular channel of the House Intelligence Committee? Exactly how soon was Cantor contacted by FBI sources after Petraeus was exonerated by the investigation? What was the decision making process of those involved in contacting congressmen Reichert and Cantor? Who exactly in the FBI was involved in that discussion? How many people? What was their connection to the investigation? Or was it a single rogue individual? Did Cantor ever notify Speaker Boehner that he had been contacted and that he had contacted Mueller? Why not? What does Boehner have to say about what Cantor did? Did Cantor or any House staff member speak about the matter with any member of the RomneyRyan campaign? Claims that Cantor was simply alerting the FBI of the investigation by contacting Mueller are

absurd on its face. The FBI knew it was conducting the investigation. What is Cantor covering up? Was he attempting to create pressure to force Petraeus' scandal into the public and his resignation before the election? What was the connection between those involved in contacting Cantor and those involved in contacting Bob Woodward about a "Benghazi" story? If there were irregularities in the investigation, the disgruntled FBI agents or employees should have contacted the FBI Inspector General. They did not. Was it because there were no irregularities? No one has suggested any. Did they know it is a felony to disclose an espionage investigation? Will the FBI agent(s) and employee(s) who leaked the espionage investigation to congressmen Reichert and Cantor be the targets of a Justice Department criminal investigation? Will a grand jury be empaneled?
