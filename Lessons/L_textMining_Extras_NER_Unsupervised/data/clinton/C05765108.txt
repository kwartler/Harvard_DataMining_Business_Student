Congressional Issues
* Rich flagged that the climate bill was supposed to be marked up starting today, but the Republicans were rumored no shows. Health care is stalled in the House because of abortion provisions; they were taking 72 hours to work it and that meant the House discussion may not start this week.
* Senate was looking at more cloture votes for next week (Arturo?). Rich was going to take Tom Shannon up to see DeMint

 Some discussion of what the strategy was on

omination;

Deputy Secretaries Meeting Highlights
EU Meetings
 Phil confirmed that yes, the EU was good to go forward with Jim chairing tomorrow's events and a possible Secretary phone call in to the meeting at the top which he said he had run by Huma.
10 Issues
 Esther said the GA resolution on Goldstone wasn't as drastic as it could have been, though it still crossed our redlines; New York was working it. Austria is the November UNSC chair and their theme for the month will be protection of civilians. She also highlighted discussion in the Security Council about a statement welcoming Afghanistan's elections results; Jim said NY reps seemed disconnected from capitals since most capitals had independently welcomed the results already, so he didn't understand why it would be controversial at all.

 Esther said El Baradei's farewell speech was pretty neutral in tone about Iran -- he had said they needed to provide clarification.
GTMO Detainees
O Dan F highlighted the Uighurs, who are going with the Palawan President to his favorite scuba diving spot; said
