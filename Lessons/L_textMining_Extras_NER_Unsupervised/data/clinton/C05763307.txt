SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
Here are the highlights of the 8/4 Senior Staff Meeting:
Cheryl Mills
 Noted the mission of former President Clinton to N. Korea and stressed the need for all statements pertaining to this to come out of the White House. Robert Wood (PA) said he was planning to brief today, but would refuse to answer any questions on this matter and refer journalists to the W/H statement.
Jack Lew
 Reported that Nita Lowey had released the hold on land in Afghanistan for the Ministry of Health. She voiced concern, however, that the Department was using various means to circumvent limits Congress is imposing on land acquisitions. Pat Kennedy insisted that this was not the case, adding that there are clear legal restrictions on what we can and cannot do with real property abroad. (An example he cited is the property associated with our old Chancery in Port-au-Prince where we cannot legally give the property away, but the only real potential buyer is the Government of Haiti which has yet to make an offer.)
Rich Verma
 Said the SFRC Business Committee meeting today should report out 22 nominees. Noted a problem with Mike Posner, but said he was working to keep him on the agenda. There are holds still on 17

nominees, mostly by Senator Kyle, but Carlos Pascual seems ironically now to be free of all holds. The ambassador-designate for Canada, Jacobson, has a hearing scheduled for tomorrow, but we were unable to pair anyone with him.  Jack Lew asked Rich where we are with respect to the report to Congress needed to allocate the remaining 15 percent of the Merida Initiative money to Mexico. Rich said that the report should be presented to Congress by August 13, after consultations with human rights NG0s. (Sheba Crocker indicated that Jim Steinberg's office has been hearing steadily from the NGO Community, including the head of Human Rights Watch, Tom Malinowski. Malinowski insists there would be no harm in withholding the money for now, since the Mexican Government is not in a position to expend the funds yet, and since it is not yet clear whether there will be civilian trials of military personnel accused of human rights violations.)  There was a brief discussion of whether the titles of the nominees for E and EEB could be changed after their nominations and/or confirmation. M undertook to explore this further with L.
Harold Koh
 Noted that he was reviewing a statement that AF wanted to put out in advance of the Secretary's arrival in Kenya
Harold said that L Cheryl asked to see the statement before its release.
Dan Smith
 Noted apparently no American Citizens killed or injured in today's air crash in Thailand.  Said that both he and Pat Kennedy had flagged for Lew Lukens in the context of the Secretary's current
travel the issue of airplane fuel shortages in South Africa as a result of labor unrest.
Here are the highlights of the Deputy Secretaries 9:15 chaired by Jack Lew:
Curt Campbell
 Reiterated the need to maintain radio silence on former President Clinton's private, humanitarian trip to N Korea.
Jack Lew
 Said we are in the home stretch on the senior reviews and hope to have a package ready for the Secretary upon her return from Africa. Indicated that overall OMB will likely think we are "aggressive" in our budget request, but that reflects the reality of the challenges we face in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Jeff Feltman
 Noted that the family of missing American Citizen Robert Levinson have now asked whether former President Clinton will travel to Iran to obtain the release of Mr. Levinson, even though the Iranians have never acknowledged holding him.
 Said it was clear after the visit of the Kuwaiti Amir that we have a lot of work to do on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi border issues.
 Noted that Abu Mazen had made a two-hour speech at the Fatah Party Congress that will provide plenty of grist for Israeli complaints.
