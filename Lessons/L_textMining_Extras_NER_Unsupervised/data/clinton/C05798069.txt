Mills, Cheryl D <MillsCD@state.gov> Tuesday, January 15, 2013 8:29 AM
Abedin, Huma; Reines, Philippe I; Sullivan, Jacob Just spoke to Tom D

He reaffirmed timing.
I suggested he call JK as the best interlocutor on this matter; he's calling him am so there can be a coordinated departure/swearing in on 1 February.
I also shared our latest information from Corker's team re seeking their 7 days for QFRs (taking the committee to 30 or 31 Jan).
I advised that if there was some unforeseen hiccup, you would be prepared to stay the next week or two to ensure no gap in leadership.
