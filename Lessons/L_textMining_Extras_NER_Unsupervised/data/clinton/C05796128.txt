Just talked again with Thant.

1.4(B)

So yes, Nirav, pis see if you can work on this upon 1 . 4(D) arrival. Burmese apparently want to decide finally on this by tomorrow (Mon). When asked when we would want TS to B1 speak at the event, I told Thant to tell his NPT interlocutors that we are are fully flexible and can rearrange agenda according to his preferences.

He said he will report all this back again to NPT in the morning (Burma time) so if there's any update from Camb MFA mtg tonite pls let me know so I can pass on. Thanks much.

On another issue, Thant Myint-U just called to relay a request from the Presidential Office in NPT asking whether Thein Sein would get a meeting w/S should he accept an invitation "from the Cambodians" to travel there next week. I responded we had a great interest in TS traveling to Cambodia next week to provide him a platform to talk about changes in Burma and would expect a meeting with S would be looked on favorably if he did travel. Thant said this message/request will be passed thru the embassy in Rangoon. I wanted to alert you all soonest as well. Not sure it means for certain that TS will travel but good sign.
