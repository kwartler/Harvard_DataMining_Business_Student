RAMALLAH (AP) - A top Palestinian official says the Palestinians will ask the U.N. General Assembly to
recognize Palestine as an observer state. Saeb Erekat said Sunday that the timing of the request will be decided next week by the Arab League. The Palestinians seek a state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in 1967. U.N. recognition is largely symbolic, since Israel continues to control these territories to varying degrees. A
nod from the world body would endorse the pre-1967 lines as the border of a future Palestinian state. Palestinians fear that border is being erased by Israeli settlement building.
The General Assembly can recognize Palestine only as an observer. A bid to win full U.N. membership was derailed by insufficient Security Council support last year.
