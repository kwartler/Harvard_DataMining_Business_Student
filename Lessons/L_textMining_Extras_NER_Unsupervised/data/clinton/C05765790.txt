UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05765790 Date: 02/13/2016
 Senator Lugar is introducing legislation that would provide a "bridge" if START is not signed on time.
 Still looking at Afghanistan/Pakistan rollout and possible hearing for the Secretary with Gates and Mullen on December 1.
Legal Issues  Harold noted he was following up on the Secretary's decision to let the court know of general U.S. interests that could be affected by the Gilmore case involving a default judgment against the Palestinian Authority. DOJ seemed to be balking, however, so it is not clear whether we will have to escalate.  With respect to the upcoming ICC conference, Harold noted that we would "be present and be low key," although DoD is attempting to "micromanage" things, a reflection of their general hostility toward the ICC.  There will be a filing today in the DC Circuit Court on Bagram arguing against the right of habeas for prisoners there. So far, the NGO community has been remarkably quiet.
Public Affairs O There will be an IAEA report on Iranian compliance this afternoon that will likely leak out quickly. O Expect questions on Palestinian request for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Assistant Secretaries Meeting-- Highlights OES
 Getting ready for climate conference in Copenhagen. Will have a U.S. Center highlighting our efforts.  NGOs have expressed interest in having the U.S. ratify the Convention on Biodiversity. AF  Large Angolan delegation in Washington to follow up on Secretary's visit to Angola and announcement of a
strategic dialogue with Angola.
o G is focusing on issue of trafficking in persons in India, noting that the country remains a Tier 2 country with respect to TIP. Melanne Verveer said she has been engaged on this issue with India as well, adding that we had launched a partnership with Bollywood to raise Indian public awareness of the issue.
