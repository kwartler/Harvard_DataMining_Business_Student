Raised the speech with me about state taking over trade negotiations. When I asked if he read the speech he conceded that he did not have a problem with S or me, but things he is hearing at a staff level. I said that ustr has been playing an active role in our senior reviews and our goal was to coordinate -- not looking to take over trade negs but hoping to get the WH to pay more attention. He suggested a mtg with him, S, me and demetrius.
