All,

I just spoke to derek who wanted to relay a conversation he had today with I'll do my best to get the key points to you all:

He is having some email difficulties so

-Derek discussed our sanctions oackaee exolainine the details of the reoortine reauirements and the easine

-Atmospherics: there is a growing disconnect between those inside burma and those outside. Those inside support the easing of sanctions and want BFDA not renewed. When derek is here in dc the week of the 23rd, he will hold an NGO roundtable and convey these sentiments.
7--nentioned a resolution that was coming up (introduced by a shan woman but shwe mann is taking the credit)
calling sanctions harmful. Looks to be a lot of support.
There will be a cable on the conversation but derek wanted to ensure you all received the information quickly.
Best, Erin
