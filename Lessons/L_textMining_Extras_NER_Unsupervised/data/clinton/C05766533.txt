RELEASE IN PART B5

From: Smith, Daniel B To: Mills, Cheryl D; Abedin, Huma; Sullivan, Jacob Sent: Tue Dec 22 11:16:50 2009 Subject: 12/22 Senior Staff and Deputies Meetings
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED
ANTI-GAY LAWS
 Cheryl noted that she had raised with Johnnie Carson the need to look at what anti-gay laws other African countries, besides Uganda, had adopted or were considering. In the subsequent Deputies Meeting, Johnnie noted the proposed draconian legislation in Uganda as well as the Secretary's intervention with Museveni. He indicated he would send a message to all our African posts asking them to report on similar legislation or efforts in their countries and to provide their thoughts on a strategy, including public diplomacy efforts, to counter this trend.
BUDGET
 Pat noted that while we have nothing concrete yet with respect to the FY 2011. Budget, OMB has raised the possibility of additional fee revenue for State, but their numbers seem questionable and may include some double counting.
 In the subsequent Deputies Meeting, Jack noted that we were in the final stages of negotiations on the 2011
Budget, adding that there had been a decision to separate war funding from non-war related funding. Jack warned that the pressure to hold
down non-war related funding would be intense, suggesting bureaus be prepared to prioritize,their requests quickly.
CONGRESSIONAL ISSUES
 Rich has drafted a letter from the Secretary to Senator Lautenberg to ask him to lift his hold on GSP and the Andean Trade Preference legislation stemming from the Goldman case in Brazil. The Chief Justice may issue a ruling this morning, but depending on that ruling or if there is another delay, the letter may be the only option.
 Senate will likely pass its version of the Iran sanctions legislation.
 The Senate National Security Working Group has asked for another briefing by Rose. Rich will check with the WH but thinks this makes sense.
 Still a chance our nominees could be approved by the Senate this week.

 The UN Commission Report on the atrocities in Guinea provides a basis for a gender-based violence prosecution, Harold noted. He thinks the ICC might do this, although they don't want to be seen as only prosecuting crimes in Africa. Right now, however, there are three possible Africa-related prosecutions that Ocampo could proceed with -- Kenya, Congo and Guinea.
 Harold said our past expert nominees to various international judicial bodies (i.e. torture committee, human rights committee) have been self-selected. L is working with DRL and 10 to initiate a more pro-active approach to finding the right people.
PUBIC AFFAIRS  PJ said there is a report that a group of AIDS activists are planning to go caroling at the Secretary's NY home this afternoon to protest inadequate AIDS funding.
Philippines  I noted that the Mayon volcano appears on the verge of erupting. 50,000 have been evacuated. EAP reported in the subsequent meeting that PACOM is ready to provide relief. We are also coordinating with AID.
DEPUTIES MEETING -- HIGHLIGHTS AF
 Esther noted that the UN Commission Report on Guinea was "truly appalling," and that possible next steps include consideration in the Security Council and/or the Human Rights Council.
 Johnnie said he would have a memo to Jack shortly with some mitigation strategies with respect to humanitarian assistance to Somalia.
GTMO  We are down to 198 detainees. DOJ acknowledged that we had returned some detainees to Yemen because of the likelihood of no success in their habeas cases.
PM
CHINA  Michael Posner said we expect the verdict in the trial of Liu Xiaobo on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. He will likely receive 10-12 years. DRL has prepared a press statement.
