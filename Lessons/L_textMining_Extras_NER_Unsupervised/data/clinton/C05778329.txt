Via Ops:
The following is additional information received on the killing of two American soldiers in Frankfurt:
 Mission wants to send out Warden message tonight.  There is no information that threat to general American public has gotten worse. Ambassador is recommending
the warden message.  There is some discussion about whether Dept or DoD will issue statement. POTUS just issued statement.  Note: Post says it IS believed the perpetrator targeted the U.S. military specifically, as the bus was blue and
white and clearly said "Air Force" on the side. The perpetrator apparently yelled "God is great" in Arabic before opening fire. He stated he is on his own, however, which is the reason many at post were reticent to send a warden message, but Ambassador wants to be forward leaning. Ambassador is very concerned about the possibility of something happening tonight, so does not want to miss the chance to alert all U.S. citizens.
Consul General in Frankfurt reported at 1322:
 German police are in the midst of investigation. FBI is on the scene.  Two wounded were taken to University Medical center; one is NOT expected to live (according to police
information following a shot to the head)  Names of two dead not released yet. One of the dead was the driver, wearing a U.S. military uniform. Other
deceased was shot outside of the bus, wearing civilian clothes, but believed to be identifiable as an American soldier.  Ten survivors are now speaking with police and assisting in the investigation; post is working to ensure they will have safe transport to their onward destinations.  General Dillon is not at the site, as reported in the cable (Frankfurt 1080); Airport office of special investigations is on the scene. Military is being instructed not to wear uniforms in the area for awhile.  There has been a reluctance to move the bodies until investigation has concluded.  Post has contacted local police to request additional security for housing and consulate.  Police have secured his apartment and are searching it now.  Passengers had arrived from Lakenheath, England and were en route to Afghanistan.
