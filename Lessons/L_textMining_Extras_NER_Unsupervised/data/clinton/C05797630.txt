Understand sensitivity -- while we sort that out with WH, let's send Charge now. Wendy reminded me that Roberta has suggested several good names.

Cheryl and Bill, In my weekly meeting with Roberta, we both realized that we did not know where things are regarding a Charges or COM for El Salvador. Have any final decisions been taken? I assume even if COM is not yet resolved that we want to send a charges. Appreciate any update. Thanks. Wendy
