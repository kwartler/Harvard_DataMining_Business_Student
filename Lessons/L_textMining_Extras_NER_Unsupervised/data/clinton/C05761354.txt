Hello all: Just a heads up -- earlier today, the WH notified Congress that Eric Goosby will be nominated for the position of Global AIDS Coordinator. The official announcement will be made on Monday, but the news is largely out and in the community, with Representative Barbara Lee already doing a release. I know that the WH is coordinating with Speaker to save her official release for Monday, and I think it's good for us to wait until it's completely official to announce as well, but wanted to give heads up that people will likely be getting press questions about this. Thanks, Ann
