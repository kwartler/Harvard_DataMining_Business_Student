Marc,
I would think that Protocol would know the most about that, but I'm copying Nathan in L/EMP in case he (or one of his colleagues) can advise. (Nathan -- Marc is the director of the Japan desk.) Thanks, Jesse

Jesse -- do you or does one of your colleagues know the process of vetting individuals to serve as special envoys? We may have a need to vet someone (s) in the near future and want to make sure we understand the process so we can move quickly. Thanks,
Marc
