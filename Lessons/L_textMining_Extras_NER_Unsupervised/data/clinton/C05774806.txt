Tony, et al: Just back from a good 70-min meeting with Pres Karzai. Made the points I noted I'd lay out in the email below, and had a good discussion. Provided a lot of specifics for each issue to show where we've made changes in recent months, provided detailed assessments of what the targeted operations have accomplished, agreed with the need to ensure that our actions, together with those of our Afghan partners, garner support of the people, and so on. And did underscore the need for a united front as we go forward.

Again, productive session. Vr - Dave UNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05774806 Date: 02/13/2016

I have a one-on-one with Pres K for an hour at 1200 today, too, Tony, and I'll stress the need for a unified front. I will also be laying out in detail the programs we're executing to address the various items of concern, while also noting that we all want to arrive at the same place, but it will take time and we need to resolve any differences behind closed doors. And the US can't be seen as having to go it alone in this effort, either. Best - Dave

I have a call out to Spanta and will reach out to Daudzai. Jim Keith will reach out to the acting Foreign Minister. Mark Sedwill is reaching out to Spanta and Ghani also.
