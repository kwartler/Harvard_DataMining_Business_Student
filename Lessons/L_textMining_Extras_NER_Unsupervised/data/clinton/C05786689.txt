Dan Benjamin chaired an intra-Dept session on the MEK/Ashraf today, and the group will gather again on Monday, following a meeting by UNHRC/UNAMI at Ashraf on Saturday and an Embassy meeting with the MEK on Sunday. Main points:
 UN: The UN is primed to register (at Ashraf) and interview (away from the camp) the 3200 camp residents, but needs: Iraqi approval of an interview location, Iraqi approval for the residents to return to camp (or, alternately, GO! and MEK agreement that the residents would relocate elsewhere in the country -- as put forward by the Embassy earlier in the "Butler Plan"), MEK agreement that Iraqi nationals can participate in the process (i.e., in a support function -- not as interviewers -- which they currently reject), and materiel support (helicopter lift). PRM used the visit of UNHCR Guttierez this week to push hard for close UN coordination and appropriate resourcing of the operation.
 Iraq: The GO! has as its main goal the dissolution of the camp and does not want the residents to return to Ashraf following interviews. It is not clear where the GOI would want the residents to go -- to take up residence in an Iraqi urban center, to reconstitute elsewhere in Iraq, or to depart for Iran (although Maliki and other continue to say there will be no forced returns). 122 camp residents have warrants against them in Iraqi courts. Iraq has signed an agreement with Iran on the repatriation of residents to Iran, with ICRC attempting to track down a copy.
 ,ICRC: has overseen the repatriation of 500 residents to date (over the last years). They are prepared to facilitate voluntary returns, including arranging modalities and monitoring treatment afterwards. The Regional Director will be here next week.
 Returns: The 50 or so residents with other, non-Iranian passports, are beginning to empty out. 11 to Canada; 5 to the US (including 2 with U.S. criminal indictments, who will be met by law enforcement); 7 to Italy; 3 to Australia; 3 to the Netherlands. The EU Special Adviser will be here next week and we can reinforce message on need for other countries to step up.
