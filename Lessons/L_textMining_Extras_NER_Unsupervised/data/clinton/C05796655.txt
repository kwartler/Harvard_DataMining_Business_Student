Cable to follow, but given interest a low-side initial readout:

I saw Egyptian Amb Auf today. His assessment very upbeat: Positive press coverage reflects substance of meetings. SAG chose to engage with Morsi as President of Egypt, not MB figure. Most meetings were just Amb, Morsi, FM and EGIS chief. They talked prisoners; SAG will release some in Ramadan. They talked investment and trade; Saudi Trade minister will go after Ramadan to Egypt, both sides highlighted importance of resolving trade disputes and clearing the way for more investment opportunities. Morsi emphasized non-interference in internal affairs, standing with Saudi and the Gulf in the face of Iran, deep respect for the Kingdom as reflected in choosing to come to Saudi on first overseas trip. Meeting with CP Sa!man focused mostly on econ issues, again very positive. Egypt and Saudi as twin pillars of the Arab world, when they agree all will follow. Importance of relationship affirmed all around, groundwork laid for strong future ties that will be demonstrated in a slew of post-Eid bilateral visits. Asked about financial assistance, Auf simply said the Saudis have delivered fully on their promises to date.

Morsi also met with Egyptian citizens here, they are demanding a parliamentarian be specially elected to represent them, also want customs and educational concessions. Morsi (who is popular with Egyptian expats here) enjoyed the meeting, which went well -- real constituency politics in action, something he seemed to enjoy.

Our Pol section went over to MFA today to see Arab Affairs Director (I'll see Deputy FM Prince Abdulaziz bin Abdullah

tomorrow in Jeddah -- he was in the meetings with Morsi (and with Abu Mazen)). MFA official said this was more of a

get to know you meeting than anything else. Egyptians asked for more money/financial support --Saudi response on

this, as in much else was "we'll wait and see."

'B1

not necessarily a successful pitch.) Generally positive meetings, but

1.4(D)

n added layer of potential problems. Nothing wrong with the visit so much as nothing particularly right

about eitrie. Protocol and honor were served on all sides, but how much upside there is to this relationship depends

on what Mors' does....

That's the initial snap-shot from here. Saudi line does seem to have switched a bit from (which was very much where Naif was, and other senior Saudis as well) to a more guarded/nuanced,

B1 1.4(D)

there seems to be some emergent faith that now in government Morsi will have to tack

more pragmatic and less ideological, though the Saudis are cautious and will likely play a bit of a wait and see

game. There is considerable

although whether that's

Dr not

is a different matter.

More once I talk to AAA.

I will say that Morsi took the unusual step after his mtg with the king to say how good the meeting was, and that cp salman confirmed that this was the case. Everyone at pains to present correct public image. Won't know the backstory until I can get in to see Deputy FM, who was in the mtg...
