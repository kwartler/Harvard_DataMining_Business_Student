For a review, refer to _Electrical_Experimenter_, March 1919 and June 1919.  Rogers' methods were used extensively during the World War, and was unclassified after the war. Supposedly, the government rethought this soon after, and Rogers was convieniently forgotten.  The bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send HALF of their signal THRU the ground. The half that travels thru space is quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. Furthermore, the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.  IF you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the man who INVENTED wireless: Tesla. Tesla confirmed that Rogers' methods were correct, while Hertzian wave theory was completely ""abberant"".  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

Is there any real-world application >for Tesla coils today ? > >David Prutchi  First of all, realize that Tesla invented AC power generators, motors, transformers, conductors, etc. Technically, *ALL* transformers are Tesla coils.  In general though when someone refers to a Tesla coil, they mean an ""air core resonant transformer"". The TV flyback version Tesla coil (see the _Encyclopedia_of_Electronic_Circuits_ V3, 106-1 for diagram) has NOT an air core. It is of a class of circuit called ""Oscillating Shuttle Circuit"" (OSC). Generally OSC's are highly efficient, but this version uses transistors and resistors, which are very lossy devices. Typically Tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors, so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99.5%, and better. The usual application of an air-core resonant transformer, or of an OSC, is to produce strong EMI for wireless broadcasts. How well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the HF HV Tesla (flyback) coil from it? If we were to remove from our homes and industries all Tesla coils, our lights would go dark, our cars would sputter and die, our radios would go silent, our industries would grind to a halt, and we would have to go back to using coal for heat, gas for lamps, horses for transportation, steam for power, and telegraph for communication. Is that real world enough for you???????  GET THE MESSAGE! WE WOULD NOT HAVE 1/100 THE CONVIENIENCES WE HAVE TODAY IF NOT FOR TESLA. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE!  If it had been up to Edison, we'd still be in the 19th century. (flame me at your own peril. I'm very good at putting edison down).  ----  ET   ""Tesla was 100 years ahead of his time.

I was wondering if anyone out there knows of a DRAM controller which will handle refreshing the data.  It's ok if the controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.  The only controllers I know of are the ones out of the National Semiconductor DRAM Management Handbook (1988 edition) eg. DP8429.  I would like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to implement in my circuit.  BTW, if anyone is wanting to hook up DRAM to a microcontroller, Dallas Semiconductor makes a neat chip: the DS1262 Serial DRAM Nonvolatizer Chip.  It uses the SPI (I2C) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16Mx1 of DRAM memory.  It can use an external battery to refresh the DRAM when the power is off.  Price is $11.75 from Dallas (quan 1).  I wish I could use this chip but its maximum SPI clock rate is 1 MHz (too slow for me...).

For instance, my  486 has adjustable AT bus speeds, and my PAS16 audio card chokes when I do  AD data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10MHz.  The fact that non-turbo-mode speed A/D doesn't work is weird.  You may  have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.    33 MHz bus on the 486DX2 66 does refer to the local bus.

I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil. spec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C and sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time delay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this application, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset. When triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x the timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it is, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K resistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of 2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !) Of course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'. After the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth.  Power is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see what I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns off ;-)  Thanks again everyone...  -=-= Wes =-=-","electronic"

The only consolation is that manufacturers are _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.

I recently evaluated the latest box from Tek - their TDS320 - which seems to be a worthy alternative to a standard 100MHz analogue CRO. This instrument has a 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time capture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in the range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at least they appear to be logically laid out. |>  |> There are only three situations for which I would prefer a digital |> scope: Looking at what happened before the trigger, looking at rare |> events, and acquiring the data to have my computer play with it. |>  |>  |> Let's hope scope manufacturers are listening... |>  |> Best regards, |> Jeroen Belleman |> jeroen@dxcern.cern.ch  One more thing about the new, ""simpler"", front panels. These instruments tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement over the old oak switch. The single most common cause of failure in our scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these switches. I look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the longevity of the instruments.

Your 2F2 cap will have been designed as a RAM battery substitute, rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current. Their performance, in some respects, is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap. The other point is that big electro's are usually rated with -5%+20% tolerances, so calculating exactly what capacitance you have (particularly when considering the cold).  You should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain, that ""rolls over"" (from zero to maximum count, or vice-versa) once every 1,209,600 seconds. If you were to use something like a 110Hz clock, you would need a divider chain of 2^27, to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period. Of course, you could trim the 110Hz oscillator to give you exact time, but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at -40 is low anyway.  I would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit.  Caveat - I'm not experienced in low temperature electronics, so I can't guarantee that this (or any other) approach is the best for inhospitable conditions.

The electrolytic capacitor is 330 mF at 250WV.  It has radial leads, and is roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8"" wide.  The dimensions are important since the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.

Raw HC11 parts have factory set ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.  Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing the EPROM array to light.

Fortunately, wire-wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies; Cray computers (up to the X-MP, at least) all had wirewrapped backplanes.  Wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any TTL can handle.

What you have is one of the LD players from a video game (Dragon's Lair, Space Ace, etc). Call Pioneer Technicial Support 213-498-0300 (at least that's the number I called them at) and ask for the LD-V1000 Interface Guide. It shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes for the commands (play, pause, reject, etc).

Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESE have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice while wearing the watch on one's wrist).

Only one blinker is used.  Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open, this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.   Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.  What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light  at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current  from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing  both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a  low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow  at reduced brightness.   Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires  in a safe manner!","electronic"

Good gravy! Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms in an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted notation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude* (rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB. So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation such as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.  For power:    dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )  For amplitude    dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )  'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel. It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for the common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation convention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.  Common references for audio are:  	0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 	0 dBV = 1 volt  	0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level) 	0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)   Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment.  Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the power will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm's law.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Likewise, if anybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.

If you could find the specs this might just work for you...  I believe that the ""A-D converters"" found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab measurements off something as non-linear as that.  Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher voltages would be more precise).  On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...  					---Joel Kolstad","electronic"

Thus, if part of the memory is used as a ""function table"", then ""looking up"" a value of that function for a value of the  variable which is obtained in the course of the computation requires that the machine itself should modify, or rather make up, the reference to the memory in the order which controls this ""looking up"", and the machine can only make this modification after it has already calculated the value of the  variable in question.

Why are you fooling around with analog for this job?  A single chip micro and a crystal will do the job reliably and easily.  An 8748 only costs about $5.  That and a $1 crystal and you're in business.  Embed the whole thing in a foam insulated blanket, power it from a solar cell, use the excess power to heat the assembly during the day and rely on the insulation to hold the heat during darkness.  If you don't want to try thermal management, contact someone like ICL and have them cut you a special low temperature crystal.  It'll cost at most $20.  If you use a single chip micro, you're looking at a parts count of  maybe 7.  A processor, a crystal, two caps on the crystal, a power FET to fire the solenoid a flyback diode and a battery.  This is fewer parts than  you can build an analog timer for and is infinitely more reliable.  Add a power zener diode (for heat) and a solar cell and the parts count screams up to 9.  PD assemblers are available for all the common single chip micros.  This application is so trivial you could even look up the op codes in the  programmer's guide and create the binary with a hex editor.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output voltage as possible. (about 260v).   The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages (ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v across them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.   Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.  If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will increase the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem. These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of them, So:  1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel  with the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?   Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase the RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone... as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this new capacitor will 'smooth' this out.  and 2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !    I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCH of a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get my  dissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing not playing with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the long run... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)

I think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion, in a counter-intuitive fashion (HP has made some strides in their 54600 series, IMO). Automatic setups are fine for simple, repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scope in ""equivalent time"" or in ""real time"" sampling mode (equivalent time being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual sampling rate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture but before display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.  Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHz sample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose front end including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important for equivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.  So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where I need storage for later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability of the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes to fall...  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Chiu knows the score and is just being silly. However, ""decibel"" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. He is right on that one, but I don't know if it was accidental or not.  Strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels, and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10X decibels for every bel, hence bel=log(P2/P1) and decibel=10Xlog(P2/P1).  The bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are all named for pioneers in the field. It's a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field. Hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers, but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.) All the other units were defined many decades earlier.       --  ----------------------------------------------------------------------     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ","electronic"

If you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.  The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle (even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of the law is no excuse - they will get you too!  It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.  Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!""  But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one, and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.  Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.  For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave enlightment may be necessary.  So, the questions are -   What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?   Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by   a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector   antenna?

The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.  This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove noise (static).  I built it and it really works well.

A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?  I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays ""quiet"", AC-wise. But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control of my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, but I'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring/redesign.

The best info I have seen so far is the article ""Joystick Metrics: Measuring physical properties through the PC's joystick port"" by Michael Covington in the May 1985 issue of PC Tech Journal.

It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want to use BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC Technical Reference under Options and Adapters.

For those who have not heard of this effect, you put a current through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one side to the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  I think a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.  Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box for picnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with an efficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour).  Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as the temperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumably its power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming no leakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more (although that would be a lousy way to control it).  What I would like to know is:  1: Are the above guesses correct?  2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?    (I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm    too fast when I unplug it)  3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks like    magic!  4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?   Thanks in advance,  Paul.

The only way  to get gain (>1) out of an antenna is to design in directionality. The  ""gain"" of an antenna is defined as the signal increase (for a preferred  direction) over the signal obtained by an isotropic antenna.  Bob Sciamanda Edinboro Univ of PA","electronic"

March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article about dimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase- control as the best method for controlling brightness.   I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzing filaments and non-linear adjustment range. I had heard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle by cycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp's power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, then nothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone has tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using.

The detector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radar  detector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, there  are/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't  paid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.   I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, and  how much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detector  in a proper RF shielded enclosure.  --  Andrew Daviel, Vancouver, Canada <advax@triumf.ca>   finger advax@reg.triumf.ca for PGP key","electronic"

Then I hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands are relayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine with my Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend's VCR, it didn't work.   The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a Sony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CD player...

OK, I've asked this before, and with a new thread on these lines, I ask this again:  1: If a large hole current is run thru a resistor, will there be    I^2 * R cooling instead of heating?  2: Can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies    hole currents over normal electron currents?  3: what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of    hole mobility to electron mobility? (please quote actual    test samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,    don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,    resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,    magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).  NOTES:     to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only area    where holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, hole    particles only exist in the presence of matter.    Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain    semi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is if    the hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the point    where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).    I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whether    holes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask for    an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such    currents *if* they exist.    Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronics    since this is now becoming an electronic discussion.  Thanx, Eric.  ----  ET   ""A Force of Nature"" ----","electronic"

Umm, when I was doing sound reinforcement for a living, I used to get direct boxes (which convert unbalanced 1/4"" jacks to balanced XLRs) for about $25 each, or a little more for higher quality. You'll need two for a stereo signal, of course, and a little adapter thingy from  Radio Sh#$&^t to convert from RCA to 1/4"". Total cost should be around $50. You can also buy transformers for quite a bit less and wire them yourself. Total cost there should be under $30. You can get all this stuff from any pro music shop that sells sound reinforcement gear. The benefit? NO noise that you can hear will be generated in the cables going to the component with the balanced inputs, even when you run them in bad places, like next to power lines.  ----- John Bell NASA Langley Research Center bell@hops.larc.nasa.gov ","electronic"

After having it awhile I noticed two things about the function generator. For one, there seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is, I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mV bias. 	The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessed from my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order to use my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my circuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series. With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but now with this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind of a pain in  the ass. 	Is there any way I could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generator input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'd like to have this box not be active. 	Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons I had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it.

On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway), there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment is ALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usual  condition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -  the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, but  there's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so it  takes a while).  If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter, why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screw things up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DC on charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time when you ""need"" it.  Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at least SOME of this helped.","electronic"

Ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10 ohms.  This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out 1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly less than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or the availability of parts.

Anyone seen this before?  What is happening is this: 1) You turn the TV on. 2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the    high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry. 3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down. 4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.  Things to check: First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn somewhere. Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have), if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

The stuff they will stock are the ones that'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc. i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.  The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine or the Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flip through them.  Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics, etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this? Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty good bet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa. They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer they represent.  Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them. But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what a mail order outlet will charge.  My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick with off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later.  good luck,  aaron ","electronic"

Well, one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do.  A continuous conductor is a good  electrostatic shield.  Do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things?  This shielding won't do much good for magnetic fields, unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded, like a Faraday cage.  The flip side of the coin:  if you are working with (very) high impedances, you could end up with capacitances to the gound plane that cause problems. You aren't likely to encounter this at 100Hz, but at 20kHz, it can be a real problem (one that bit me once). ","electronic"

I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to a junk ""Walkman"" style AM/FM radio. This amp ties the common path of the earphone connection to ground.  However, it doesn't work with my Sony Walkman cassette player, or the CD drive, it produces of loud low-frequency tone. Obviously Sony doesn't ground the earphone output common. Does anyone have specs on the CD drive's  output? Will an audio transformer help? What are others using to play there CD's in the Sun drive so that more than one can listen?

Ok, so your a HAM.   Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers sound  like some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they are  common IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s) which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (the local oscillator).   Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to receiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you must  generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local osc frequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.   The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Since the AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ... I think you get the picture. ","electronic"

My experience is that the CD drawer becomes a bit loose, and the CD either skips or can't be read.  Try seeing if all the screws that hold down the drawer assembly are tightened properly.

Careful now folks... Also consider the 90VAC+ @20Hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  Even with a simple zener and LED setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  Whatever scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200V-rated components on  the frontend.  Also remember that, if I'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit.  Any current you draw from the 48V or so gets dropped across that 600ohms.  That's fine until you're down to roughly 12V, when Ma Bell considers it to be off-hook.  But dropping it that far down is probably a big no-no.

This approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since, as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.  Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until you lose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter to replace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time and you've got to resync the AC in no time flat.  Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption that AC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output to be usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.  Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented back in the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as they did back then.

Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially the same TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.  #1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll  *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In any case, don't kick it around! :-)   #2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turned out to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn't shorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lying around that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see it being more than 50 cents!.  Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set of schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around the flyback. ","electronic"

The resolution you requested is about 0.3mV In order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than that.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a PC.  Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  Digital Domain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitized waveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design. (That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed - I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)  If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking at the MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) complete sampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and it uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog design guide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77db max (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces  A evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks a call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000 for application assistance.  This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.

First, it will not pass a National Electrical code inspection. Secondly, The neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.  The reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the grounded center-tap the neutral.  This gives 120v to neutral(ground) from each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  So in effect the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.   ------------------------------------------------------------------ Mark E.

No.  No.  NOOO!!!  The ground (green) wire is for safety.  No current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions.  This means that there's normally no voltage drop in it either.  It is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire... even if you're grounded in some other way at the same time.    The neutral (white) wire is, as Dave Vanderbyl correctly said, the return for the hot wire.  Since current flows in it, there's a voltage drop.  If you plug a heavy load into a properly-wired grounded outlet, you can commonly  measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground.    They are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel... but nowhere, repeat NOwhere, else.  (Well, almost.  There are strange exceptions for things like sub-panels.)  What you CAN do if you want three-prong outlets without additional wiring is  to use a GFCI outlet (or breaker, but the outlet will be cheaper).  In fact, depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.  There is a FAQ on electrical wiring, posted regularly to rec.woodworking and news.answers.  It goes into great detail on these issues (including GFCIs) and you should probably read it before asking any more questions.  I'll mail a copy to you, append a copy here, and will ask the writers to cross-post it here in the future.   	--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA Internet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055 ","electronic"

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers  	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not 	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If 	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't 	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician, 	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke; 	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.  	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National 	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC). 	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail 	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections 	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong, 	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!  	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the 	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others, 	however, do not.  Check your with your local building 	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in 	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also, 	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements 	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that 	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family 	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial 	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different 	rules.  	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in 	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary 	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada. 	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line 	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number 	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've 	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or 	``CEC''.  	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often 	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.  Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?  	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the 	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group. 	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released. 	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly 	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the 	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged 	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. 	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized 	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the 	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for 	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive -- 	US$65 plus shipping and handling.  Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?  	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up 	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance 	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. 	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two 	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments, 	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book. 	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified 	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA 	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the 	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is 	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th 	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th 	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an 	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.  	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical 	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In 	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't 	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I 	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the 	equivalent NEC publications.  	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout 	the province.  Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?  	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. 	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical 	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's 	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do 	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) 	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However, 	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial 	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can 	find one willing to supervise.  	If you do your own wiring, an important point:  	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better 	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home, 	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make 	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills 	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. 	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that 	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, 	and will impress the inspector.  	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to 	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your 	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners. 	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely 	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.  	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.  	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip 	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector 	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it 	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of 	12ga wire through your hand that way.  	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C 	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types 	become very brittle.  Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?  	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few 	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're  	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved 	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers 	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.  	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or 	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or 	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill 	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and 	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull 	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even 	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.  	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you 	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws 	work well). 	 	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or 	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper, 	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay 	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized 	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should 	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the 	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There 	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't 	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.  	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends 	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.  	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.  	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling 	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire 	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more 	accurate.  	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for 	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the 	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, 	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a 	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip 	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to 	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley 	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) 	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility 	that you'll gouge the conductors.  	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well 	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18). 	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire 	or the insulation.  	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired 	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more 	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple 	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated 	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost 	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.  	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are 	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) 	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is 	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known 	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)  	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. 	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or 	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.  	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent 	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for 	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap  	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination 	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to 	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet 	that has no cover plate).  Subject: What is UL listing?  	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be 	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent 	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment 	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means 	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements 	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily 	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just 	that it probably won't kill you.  	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are 	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However, 	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will 	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to 	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in 	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component 	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose. 	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring 	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or 	occupancy permits issued. 	 Subject: What is CSA approval?  	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the 	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in 	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done 	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to 	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is 	required by law.  	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved 	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the 	claim.  	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC 	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to 	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance 	companies.  Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?  	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers  	    Residential Wiring 	    by Jeff Markell, 	    Craftsman Books, 	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.  	    Practical Electrical Wiring 	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National 	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70 	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan 	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.  	    Wiring Simplified 	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan 	    Park Publishing Co. 	 	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC 	revision.  Which is currently 1990.  	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called 	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version 	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the 	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring, 	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get 	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer 	questions on the net ;-).  	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is 	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.  Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?  	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and 	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more 	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not 	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections 	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors 	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose 	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.  	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your 	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a 	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about 	this.  	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at 	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage 	claims.  	In general, the process goes like this: 		- you apply to your local inspections office or building 		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or 		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is 		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not 		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose 		  special conditions on you, require loading 		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point 		  they will tell you which inspections you will need. 		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to 		  have the panel and service connections inspected 		  before your power utility will provide a connection. 		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority 		  rather than the usual inspectors. 		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before 		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a 		  ""rough-in"" inspection. 		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, 		  you will need a ""final inspection"".  Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. 	Do I have to upgrade?  	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, 	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some 	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the 	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you 	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all 	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.  Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240  	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the 	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of 	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V 	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same 	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required 	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. 	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there 	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not 	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped 	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially 	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number 	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, 	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers. 	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and 	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will 	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.  	One thing that might make this a little more understandable 	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V 	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device 	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that 	low.  	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between 	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any 	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" 	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.  	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended 	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...  Subject: What does an electrical service look like?  	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the 	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility 	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.   	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded  	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes  	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where 	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic 	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)). 	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that 	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire 	normally carries no current.  	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or 	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire. 	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the 	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It 	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often 	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected 	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.  	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in 	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode. 	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral 	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional 	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house 	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.  	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually 	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are 	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one 	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations  	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do 	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your 	inspector.  	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot"" 	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as 	well.  	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each 	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires, 	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the 	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.  	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. 	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected 	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one 	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some 	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only 	service).  Subject: What is a circuit?  	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. 	These connections are then used to supply power to selected 	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations: 		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit. 		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit. 		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral, 		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.  	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and 	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying 	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they 	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several 	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is 	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or 	air conditioners.  	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar 	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there 	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral 	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing 	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead 	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. 	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles 	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but 	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC, 	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to 	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is 	permissible.]  	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, 	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.  	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a 	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.  	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground 	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC 	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends 	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail 	polish or sometimes electrical tape.  	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the 	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.  	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) 	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places 	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"", 	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an 	alternative to GFCI protection.  Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".  	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the 	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green 	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when 	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white 	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the 	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the 	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding 	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should 	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire 	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected 	together in the panel.  	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground 	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]  	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used 	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to 	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral"" 	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light 	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.  Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?  	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power 	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For 	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should 	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As 	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the 	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the 	equipment itself won't cause a fire.  	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt 	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby 	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively 	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have 	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use 	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid 	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a 	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be 	replaced.  	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They 	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched 	into position against another contact.  When the current flow 	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip 	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the 	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave 	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to 	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high 	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite 	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown 	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which 	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in 	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the 	purpose.  	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead 	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even 	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which 	can often cause severe damage.  Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?  	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher 	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually 	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts 	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse 	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a 	penny"" trick.  	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better 	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.  	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When 	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting 	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, 	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical 	distribution transformer and having your house burn down. 	Breakers don't do this.  	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit 	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new 	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special 	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)  	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse 	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse 	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the 	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently 	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you 	if you need one.  Subject: What size wire should I use?  	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit, 	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run, 	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid 	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.  	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for 	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or 	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate 	heat easily:  		Gauge		Amps 		14		15 		12		20 		10		30 		8		40 		6		65 	 	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent 	on the application and precise wire type.  Subject: Where do these numbers come from?  	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. 	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When 	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is 	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need 	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in 	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long 	runs.  	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances. 	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller 	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most 	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits 	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger 	wire.  Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?  	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors 	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second 	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but 	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means 	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.  	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes 	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In 	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.  	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. 	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.  Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they 	used?  	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used 	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector"" 	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.  	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them 	together, then twist the wirenut on.  	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the 	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically 	secure.  	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check 	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the 	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.  	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or 	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers, 	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes 	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it 	goes in the wirenut properly.  	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical 	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may 	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because 	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead 	of taping it, the connection should be redone.  Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?  	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures 	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the 	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the 	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other 	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of 	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any 	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking 	the circuit.  	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If, 	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral 	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI 	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot 	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the 	GFCI happy.  	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric. 	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed 	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be 	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices 	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be 	covered by a single GFCI outlet.  Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?  	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase 	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, 	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or 	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water 	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, 	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', 	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and 	laundry appliances.  	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there 	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or 	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you 	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to 	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.  	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may 	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI 	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI 	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in 	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your 	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children? 	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does 	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?  Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?  	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a 	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run 	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers, 	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs 	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that 	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary 	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most 	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no 	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring 	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.  Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?  	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the 	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with 	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI 	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE 	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one 	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch 	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), 	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a 	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive; 	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on 	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such 	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.  	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use 	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use 	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.  	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one 	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't 	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first 	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet 	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But 	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.  	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little 	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark 	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which 	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the 	test button and see which outlets are dead.  Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?  	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, 	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without 	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against 	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of 	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an 	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the 	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly 	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not 	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if 	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of 	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very 	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace 	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).  	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In 	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with 	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating 	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will 	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; 	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were 	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to 	ground...  Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization  	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the 	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) 	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. 	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the 	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to 	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).  	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.  	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right 	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the 	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the 	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. 	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which 	prong the terminating screw connects to.  Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?  	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance 	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex 	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more 	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider 	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet. 	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except 	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits 	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, 	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be 	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).  	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab 	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to 	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. 	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When 	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be 	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral 	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect 	from downstream outlets.  Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?  	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to 	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in 	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.  Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?  	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. 	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM. 	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside 	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject 	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are 	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several 	different categories of NM cable.  	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a 	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is 	fairly resistant to damage.  	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic 	sheath. 	 	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable 	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer 	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC) 	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected 	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of 	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.  	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored 	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, 	but this is technically illegal.]  	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the 	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague 	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC 	and CEC):  	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage 	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls 	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. 	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. 	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces 	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian 	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet 	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable 	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance. 	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. 	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating 	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by 	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation 	      material (a wad of fiberglass). 	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box 	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. 	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"". 	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to 	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation, 	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical] 	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge. 	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring 	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured 	      in the breach...] 	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or 	      similar finish. 	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. 	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists 	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more 	      than 1m (39"").  	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small 	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to 	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through 	the insulation.  	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by 	solid wall coverings.  	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of 	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a 	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of 	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the 	wire.  	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.  	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will 	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like 	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of 	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground 	wiring section.]   	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be  	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that  	purpose.  	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through 	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed 	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this 	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses 	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building. 	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. 	  	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,  	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the  	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"". 	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.  	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes 	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. 	There are very different requirements for mobile homes. 	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything 	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable 	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box 	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic 	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.  	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable 	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still 	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also 	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.  	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for 	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground 	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other 	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For 	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.  Subject: Junction box positioning?  	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.  	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible 	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction 	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may 	get nasty.  Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?  	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few 	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage 	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half 	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire 	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle 	constraints as well.  For example, older house 	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess 	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the 	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. 	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high 	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your 	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case 	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)  	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some 	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and 	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy 	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box 	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling 	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available 	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and 	mounted between the joists.  	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as 	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated 	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. 	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated 	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually 	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering 	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet* 	long)  	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3"" 	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. 	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, 	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. 	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't 	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector 	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get 	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown 	in later.]  	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and 	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are 	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat 	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should 	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses. 	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location 	for the sensor can vary.  	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved 	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.  Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?  	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is 	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up 	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with 	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can 	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in 	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions 	require the stove frame connected to neutral).  	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately 	and have them come and check out the problem.  	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with 	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A 	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness 	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.  Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?  	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of 	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors 	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque, 	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.  	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between 	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal 	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the 	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.  	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually 	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you 	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to 	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is 	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have 	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a 	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if 	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to 	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an 	article on how to do this if you must.  	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using 	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.  Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?  	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there 	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply 	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times 	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also 	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor 	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the 	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.  	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more 	than 50 feet long.  Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?  	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746 	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, 	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200 	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, 	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational 	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.  	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router 	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far 	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall 	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when 	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. 	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that 	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker 	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far 	more current than it can continuously.  	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This 	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure, 	check the amperage rating, which is always present.  Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?  	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead 	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety 	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither 	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.  	There are several different approaches to solving this: 	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the 	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect 	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle 	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise. 	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and 	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can 	       run a conductor to it from the third prong. 	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel. 	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug 	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI 	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI 	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong 	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets, 	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it 	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault 	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected 	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't 	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath 	       on BX cable.  	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three 	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop. 	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.  Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets? 	Should the test button work?  	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though, 	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's 	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE 	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current 	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI. 	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require 	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press 	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again: 	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially 	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.  	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground 	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The 	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the 	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never 	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand, 	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device 	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded 	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are 	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician 	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require 	it, and promised to investigate.)  Subject: How should I wire my shop?  	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all 	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies 	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the 	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for 	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or 	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have 	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp 	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles 	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights 	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared 	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two 	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a 	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand 	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.  	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the 	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. 	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each 	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same 	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and 	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have 	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit 	wrong.  	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring"" 	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used 	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be 	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.  	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V 	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. 	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you 	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled 	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of 	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much 	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)  	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, 	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop 	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to 	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. 	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' 	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. 	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to 	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy 	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.  	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished 	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And 	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop 	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might 	have a different idea.  	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop 	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.  Subject: Underground Wiring  	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use 	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic 	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots 	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion 	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is 	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically 	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, 	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion 	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And 	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.  	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to 	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about 	your specific situation.  	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power 	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.  Subject: Aluminum wiring  	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became 	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time, 	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, 	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. 	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new 	wiring.  	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum 	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. 	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper 	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential 	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.  	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as 	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When 	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes 	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each 	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes 	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance 	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/ 	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot, 	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even 	cause a fire.  	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move 	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of 	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing 	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you 	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring 	for the following things:  	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to 	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will 	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes 	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat 	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.  	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around 	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be 	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the 	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug 	       up each connection.  	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the 	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.  	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. 	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with 	       the proper screw connections immediately.  	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, 	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should 	       be repaired. 	     	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be 	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the 	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting 	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be 	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an 	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter 	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless 	       you can rent the tool.  	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring 	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above. 	     	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped 	       (not nicked) wire etc.      	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring 	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider 	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places, 	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used, 	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having 	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. 	You can do this yourself too.  Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?  	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire 	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. 	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an 	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor 	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any 	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many 	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.  	Here's some hints on what to look for:  	Obvious non-code wiring can include:  		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls 		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without 		  proper marking. 		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of 		  a GFCI) 		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) 		- Switched neutrals 		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines  	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one 	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:  		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps 		   not properly terminated wiring) 		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are 		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when 		  it's *really* convenient ;-) 		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations 		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps 		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them 		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or 		  ceiling 		- Backwrapped grounding wires  Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring 	 	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different 	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you 	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old  	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.  	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called 	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with 	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural 	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). 	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections 	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping 	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately, 	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs 	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture. 	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some 	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same 	colour as the hot wires.  	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.  	Comments on K&T:  		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about 		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. 		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up 		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in 		  quite good condition. 		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install. 		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with 		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either, 		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. 		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between 		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to 		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on 		  any circuit. 		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls 		  that contain K&T. 		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be 		  tricky.  Consult your inspector. 		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more 		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did. 	 	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't 	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should 	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and 	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly 	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on 	new circuits using modern techniques. 	 	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type 	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks 	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was 	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor. 	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback 	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole 	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at 	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.  	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if 	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as 	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. 	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several 	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink 	tubing.  	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. 	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky. 	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard 	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be 	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff - 	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.  Subject: Where do I buy stuff?  	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their 	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or 	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety 	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that 	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable 	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information. --  Chris Lewis; clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca; Phone: Canada 613 832-0541 Psroff 3.0 info: psroff-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca Ferret list: ferret-request@ferret.ocunix.on.ca","electronic"

I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want to include some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus. The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cant write a programm). So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work, please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail. (Also if there are books about this problem)  Thanks in advance (DWO)","electronic"

The cable tv companies   even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable   tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency   conferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running   into problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to look   for a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys or   the fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far   bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). As anywhere in an   administration people don't like, if You tell them to work for the money they   get... The problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their   rights in all cases. So let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get   out of our freqencies.

Is this true?  I own the Adcom 60W power amp.  As far as I'm concerned, there's no   amp which can touch it at the price range. The build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other    amps in the price range.  The whole amplifier is extremely solid   with massive heat sinks and very solid casing. If you open the amp up, there are only very good quality components    in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well.  Perfect   symmetry for both channels and TWO transformers - one for each   channel.  The binding posts on the back of the amplifier are   virtually the same as those on the Classe model 70 ie. very good.  I was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far-east   or where-ever.  But if you look in the amp and see what components   they use and how it was designed, you can easily see why the   amplifiers sound so brilliant. I cannot see why people say the amplifier won't last - not with   those quality components inside.  Sure the amp runs very fairly   hot - but that's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.  My last point, I recently auditioned the Adcom preamp something like   the 545 or something.  It was two years old and it still sounded   like new.  If you build an amplifier decently, like the Adcom's, they will   sound brilliant and last a long time - period.  Just my thoughts, but then - I do own one of Adcom's amps.  -- *********************************************************************** **    Alan Webber                                                    ** **                      webb@itu1.sun.ac.za                          ** **                      webb@itu2.sun.ac.za                          ** **                                                                   ** ** The path you tread is narrow and the drop is sheer and very high  ** ** The ravens all are watching from a vantage point near by          ** ** Apprehension creeping like a choo-train up your spine             ** ** Will the tightrope reach the end; will the final couplet rhyme    ** ***********************************************************************","electronic"

The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the Private Eye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around the head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes from the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned in front of the user's eye.  The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDA compatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept up and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that the sweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual image projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse with the background.  I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if I looked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus tracking if I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key. The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I found annoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properly used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.

There are two precision levels, one   for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil   ones. The civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if I'm wrong),   though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. But there is a way with   an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed GPS system in a house) to get the   same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated   then. If You use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),   You need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of   Your original signals. So the GPS system seems to be the better (and running)   idea for Your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't   know of an address anymore).

Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,   thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference   between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of   the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest   of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,   oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power   the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the   steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by   something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some   type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not   unobjectionable). Got it ?

The outlets that have a neutral hooked to >the ground screw seem wrong.  Anyone else think so?  Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company. The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were VERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.  In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things you can plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers they were a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically.  With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, it should be o.k. for most applications.  ---  . SLMR 2.1 .

If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz per channel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish.  Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced.

So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.  As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, most notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets, rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickup in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.  GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them regularly (using the test button).

When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor. There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.  Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%.

We would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction.   To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C 5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A that corresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT line of sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A; we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the time the init line of sonar B is activated.   We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference. We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars B and C.

In four replies, I've seen no hard numbers, so here goes:  For traces on the outside (not inner layers), expect, in 1 oz copper, at 15 amps, the following temperature rises versus width.  This is from Sams' ""Reference Data for Engineers,"" seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claims in turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...      width   Temp rise     inches  degrees C     ------  ---------      .125	100      .15	 75      .17	 60      .20	 45      .24	 30      .33	 20  At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees. Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20"" (~5mm) traces should be  ample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts the  required width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08"" width myself,  I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 is a transient or fault condition.)  (There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough? But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or just the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separate sensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)","electronic"

May I respectfully suggest you NOT do this??  The ground is supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection.  It'd never meet code, and if you now own the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...  There's a ""wiring"" FAQ that I think addresses this.  I believe an alternative is use of a GFCI, but I'm really not sure what current code allows in this area.  The GFCI senses alternate (unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific protective ground wire, at least not beyond the GFCI in the protected circuit.  GFCI breakers are available (but expensive). ","electronic"

I built 10 watt FSK transceivers at 904 MHz.  They are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 MHz. The receiver uses the MC13055 which is the same FSK receiver chip I used previouslyu in the 2 Mbps 10 GHz data link I first published in Ham Radio and which is now also in the ARRL handbook.    The MC3356, which includes a VHF converter section, could also be used at these speeds.  There is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this (the MC13056 if I remember rightly).    While using this would have let me reduce the ""external"" IF count on receive, it didn't really offer all that much help on transmit so I didn't bother with it.    The radios I built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 MHz channel but later reduced to half that.  These 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across-the-bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design.  Handling the data stream is another matter entirely.    Some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a ""beacon"" test mode.  While there is not yet end-end two-way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware (MIO also shown in the CNC proceedings), data is perfect copy at n6gn.  Even though the data clock is currently at about half speed, the a 2+ kbytes of the test text (chapter 55 of Isaiah) takes only a little over 1/8 of a second.    I've been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable (Borland IDE environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings) but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time, money and energy.    If anyone in the SF bay area wants to check it out there is also a CW ID after the text on the mark side at 904.740 MHz from beacons on Sonoma Mtn and Black Mtn (overlooking Si valley).  The antenna is horizontally polarized.    I guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your ""target"".  If you can't arrange your paths such that you have complete line-of-sight I think you'll want to address the inter-symbol-interference caused by multipath and probably link C/N budgets if paths are very far from LOS. For more details, see the 10th CNC.  I'm currently working on a spread spectrum, direct conversion design to address some of these problems. I'd be glad to help as I can with any design problems.  73 Glenn Elmore n6gn  N6GN @ K3MC       amateur IP:	glenn@SantaRosa.ampr.org Internet:	glenne@sr.hp.com   ","electronic"

THe digital side?  TTL? ECL?  We run 200MHz and 100MHz all over our IC test equipment  all day long in the ECL domain, and we use DIP's along with PLCC's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin QFP's to name a few.  I don't see a problem in packaging as long as you adhere to sound engineering practices.    A good source of information is Motorola's MECL System Design Handbook. The latest ed. is dated 2/88.  That is considered to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.  The very fact that you need to build a test fixture means you're most likely going to need a socket.  It in itself has far more inductance per pin than the package you are testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  I don't see the big concern over the packaging because it probably isn't going to make that much difference  If you're trying to get TTL to run at 100MHz, have fun... TTL was never designed to run in a 100MHz environment. :-(  aaron  P.S. My opinions have nothing to do with my company...the standard disclaimer applies.","electronic"

First, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of  major failure of the power plant).  Second, the primary water (that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the cooling tower (it's the SECONDARY water cycle that goes  through the cooling tower).

Well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips.  Use a probe with a 10M resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  If you find line-level input to both chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.    If you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough.  This is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and balance controls too).  If you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably  before the other controls).    If the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should probably forget the whole thing.   	--- Jamie Hanrahan, Kernel Mode Systems, San Diego CA Internet:  jeh@cmkrnl.com  Uucp: uunet!cmkrnl!jeh  CIS: 74140,2055","electronic"

I hear that they're called >'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?  Except for their size, the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890's (a hundred years ago) for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways.  Basicly, the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and/or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1/3 of the tower. To assist cooling and the draft, water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes. The cold water evaporates, removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft. This produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers.  That slight pinch (maybe 2/3 of the way up the tower) is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced, compared to a straight cylinder shape.  The towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again. The wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference (sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage ""hot"" turbine to final stage ""cold"" turbine).

Of course, the phrase ""TV screen"" is often thrown around in reference to any CRT display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal TV rates.

We'll let you live, but just this once....  There's more to a real ""storage"" scope than just a long-persistence phosphor.  Actually, the phosphor ISN'T usually anything special at all; what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor, which becomes charged as the electron beam intially ""writes"" the trace. With the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level ""flood"" electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the ""written"" areas on the storage screen.  There are some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage tube, and the stored trace tends to ""bloom"" with time.   Of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a frame-buffer memory anyways.  > / Filip ""I'll buy a vowel"" Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail ""fmgst+@pitt.edu""  \           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading program that's sweeping Eastern Europe: ""Hooked on Consonants!"" :-)   Bob Myers  KC0EW   Hewlett-Packard Co.      |Opinions expressed here are not                    Systems Technology Div.  |those of my employer or any other myers@fc.hp.com    Fort Collins, Colorado   |sentient life-form on this planet.","electronic"

At nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle, whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water.  As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination.  Wayne Martin   ","electronic"

A few points need to be clarified:  The Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or the metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It should never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the normal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor.    Much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation  (""orange"" outlets are often used for this, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in many cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated grounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service entrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either.   The GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is referred to in the code as the ""identified"" conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance panel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household service panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)    The Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device.    Since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding conductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load, under normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the grounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment has a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the ""U"" ground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential.  The difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few tenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not present a shock hazard.    HOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator, a metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you will get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc) Under the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of inadequate size, causing it to overheat.  With the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which increases the possibility for shock or fire.    Also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often causing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.  The Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for lightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it flows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks, and it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop between the ""hot"" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy.  (don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not it's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)  Note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any sub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this application only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground, with the possible problems listed above.  The code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one building to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate wire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review.  These exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days before U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to have to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to have to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place of three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings (since most current is in the 220 volt ""hots"" except at some low settings, the wires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage.  So far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings, it's primarily for lightning protection.  People doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding conductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in ""romex"" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere there is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good grounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does its job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall tubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.    ""Greenfield"" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have the aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield.  ""Wiremold"" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact, and the ""feed"" to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were ""hot"" with 120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator here in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can ""bond"" the wire to the box with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.  On another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets when ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them without a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the protection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't install it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is desirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is connected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in, whereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded GCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93 code is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be renumbered though.)   We have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more to this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.

In one case I route bit serial digital audio using these and it  is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given  some pretty fast edges. HC4066 is spec'd at something like -3dB @ 200MHz into  50 ohms. The more complex types are generally a little slower and more  resistive.  Plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.

Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.  (There's a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology).  So it's more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible.  Hence big cooling towers.           Oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers, but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water, not most of the way down to ambient.  Some plants do cool the condensers with water, rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal  pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".           Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils.

There are two issues here:  copyright and patent.  The magazine article's contents are copyrighted, and may not be reproduced, translated, etc., without the copyright holder's permission.  However, this does not cover the *ideas* expressed, only the form of expression.  Copying their circuit diagram or PC-board pattern is copyright infringement.  But it's unlikely that they could stretch copyright far enough to claim that the circuit design itself is copyrighted.  So long as you draw your own diagrams and lay out your own boards, copyright shouldn't be an issue.  Patents are different.  The author does *not* have to give you any warning that the design is covered by patent (although it would be sensible for him to do so).  In fact, it's possible that *he* was infringing on someone else's patent without realizing it.  Ignorance of the patented status is not a defence against infringement, although it might reduce the damages a court would award.  However... unless there was something seriously novel about the circuit, almost certainly it is ""obvious to one skilled in the art"" and therefore unpatentable.  Routine engineering is not patentable; patents (in theory) cover only inventions, ideas that are genuinely new.  Caution:  I am not a lawyer.

In expanded muxed mode, you *could* do it. Much easier if you get a DRAM controller IC. The MMI 673102 could be used to implement this, or you could use a counter and a huge multiplexer to provide row/column/refresh address multiplexing. The thing with DRAMs is that they require wierd timing, address multiplexing, and refresh.  Actually, if you wanted to use a 68008 IC, you could look at AN897, which has a neat controller built in. There is also the 683xx, I think one of those has the DRAM controller built in. This one is for the 6664 DRAM, however, the 41256 has only one more address line, adding only another component or so. The 256k SIMMs are basically 8 or 9 41256 DRAM chips (or their equivalent in fewer packages).  It *can* be done, just takes a bit of logic design. I'm actually about to do it using a 65C02P3 chip...

This description   1. ignores the role of the ballast,  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.  The bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less heat is generated from the I^2R loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge.

Availability and prices generally good.  74AS	Failed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things 	that are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.  74ALS	Possible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly 	new, availability and prices possibly a problem.  74C	Fairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with 	4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer 	CMOS 74 families.  4000	(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS 	family, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low 	power consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast. 	Very forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity, 	but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too). 	There are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The 	clear choice when speed is not important.  74HC	A new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power 	consumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for 	general-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability. 	CMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of 	supply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power 	consumption at faster speeds.  74HCT	74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read 	the fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility 	in CMOS involves some compromises.  10K	(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources 	claim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for 	serious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow 	the rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited, 	can be expensive.  100K	(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and 	inconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.  As for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and 74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices you can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using. 10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.  Me?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are interesting but I haven't used either significantly yet. --  All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology                     - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry","electronic"

I hear that they're called >'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool? >I hope someone can help    The actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft, exploiting the venturi effect.  Around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers.  Warm river water, coming from the steam condenser in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  The draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  The sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation.  It should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants.  It should also be noted that at  locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit. It was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish. Fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  Nontheless, stringent, usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  Since it typically takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed  to cool a 1000 MWe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant. --  John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

The Macroscrubber from Radio Electronics removes the protection so you  souldn't have any more problems.  However, if you use the method of  copying it from one VCR to another where the second VCR doesn't react to  the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the  protection.  One thought comes to mind about your problem...  When playing the tape  for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source VCR through an  extra device before going to the TV?  If you feed it through a second VCR  first, that is your problem.  As to other devices such as converters, I  don't know if they would react or not.

I don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such ""storys"" about them. OK ? Let me try to explain what that tower is used to:    -1st. Even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.          It has an hightech ""boiler"" but the rest is still verry verry           conventional. And if you've already visited any condensation-          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.          If you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find          a chapter about the ""CARNOT-process"" which describes how to          get energy from a temperature difference ! And that is the reason          for cooling towers too !!! You only can get energy if you've an          temperature gradient. That means that you have steam on the one           side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the           energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to          let it boil. If you only have hot steam on the one and ""cold""          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.          And so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of          energy that carnot will give them.          The cooling towers are for cooling the steam !          The vapor you'll see is NOT the steam of the main core circulation,          because that steam is radioactive ! The circulation is divided in          AT LEAST 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent          radioactive pollution of the environment !              -2nd. OK, the main core IS hot, but even in the modernst HighTemperature-          Reactors (HTR) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. This is still          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere          around 2000 deg. celsius ! But you'll have lot's of problems with          the boiler's steel. That's because at this temperature the          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.          This is only for BWR's. The new He cooled reactors have temperatures          up to 1200 deg. celsius. But this is only experimental.      -3rd. I personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the          years. Today 1 mRem and next year 0.5 mRem won't be 0.75 mRem          at all. It accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have          1.5 mRem. And i'm not interested in glowing in the night and          getting children with 2 heads. This is my point of view.            Only my 0.02$ !

It measures  the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with  5v, it reg's 5v.  Problem is when I've got the input voltage, and I wish  to lower it via a resistor.  The sensitivity of the board is so great  that I can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch  the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  A 1m resistor  only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable.                    What could the problems be and what else could I use to lower the input voltage?

I'm not sure about this.  If the ground connections on the outlets are connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground rod.  A connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.

The first one is called 'chipmunk' and is available at   hobiecat.caltech.edu or in europe at ifi.uio.no. In fact chipmunk is complete VLSI design tool  (schematic editor, layout editor, LVS, DRC...). The schematic editor   itself is called LOG.  The second one I heard of is called 'OCTTOOLS'. It is also a complete VLSI package. The fully uncompressed release takes about 130Mb of disk space.   It should be available at Berkley.  That's all I got so far.

As I recall the water isn't as hot (thermodynamically) in many >>fossil fuel plants, and of course there is less danger of radioactive >>contamination.  Actually the reasons you don't see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1) fossil units (multiple units per plant) are generally smaller than nuclear plants.  300 MWe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built.  The average nuclear plant is 1000 MWe.  2) many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted (""why those old dirt burners can't harm anything, let 'em go."").   3) powered draft cooling towers, low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off-site, are quite popular with fossil plants.  4) fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears.  >       Actually, fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual  >boiling-water reactor nuclear plants.

Some plants do cool the condensers with water, >rather than air; as one Canadian official, asked about ""thermal  >pollution"" de-icing a river, said, ""Up here, we view heat as a resource"".    Actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size.  The issues are the same regardless of where the  heat comes from.  Condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine.  The condenser pressure is normally water's vapor pressure at the condensing temperature.  It is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because  moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine  low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes.  The coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best.    A related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell (where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes.)  Since the condenser is at a very low pressure, the only force driving the  condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity.  If the condensate is too  hot or the gravity head is too low, the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate.  This is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs.    The hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps.  How much lower  they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell.  Typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120  degrees depending on the temperature of the river water (this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped.)  When the river water temperature is high in the summer, operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order  to provide more gravity head.  There is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area.  At least in the East and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air :-), the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers.  The temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity.  It is very rare in the East to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees.  A vast difference from the typical ""95-95"" days (95 degrees, 95% humidity) we see routinely in the East. It is not unusual, particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant, for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure.  >       Everybody runs closed-cycle boilers.  The water used is  >purified of solids, which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when >the water boils.  Purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than  >cooling it, so the boiler water is recycled.  True.  Actually secondary plant (the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler) water chemistry has been the bastard  stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves. The plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water.  By ""impure"", I mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and/or a few PPM of dissolved oxygen.  Secondary water is now typically the most pure one will  find outside the laboratory.  John --  John De Armond, WD4OQC               |Interested in high performance mobility?

After a while we got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone - electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt bus.    But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a  lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with  silicone).    What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world safer for electricans, anyway.    Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live  circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

What frequency is used for >the land-based beacons?  >Thanks in advance,  >Charlie Thompson >.  Here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  A reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming GPS signals.  These errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion, SA (Selective Availability) time dithering, etc.  The reference unit contains complex computational  equipment to ""back out"" the errors in its position (since it knows where it is already).  It then transmits these corrections on a  broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers.  If the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  Thus, the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit.  The US Coast Guard is currently (as far as I know) installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential GPS.  These stations will use existing radio towers.  I believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 kHz.  There are many other private corporations offering DGPS signals on different frequencies.  For example, PinPoint ((310)-618-7076) offers correction signals and receiver units using an FM broadcast system which has stations all across the US.  The correction codes are usually transmitted using the RTCM 104 format. Advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------- John P. Baker                   | My opinions are my own.

In our case, other monitors cause this problem - the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific. Have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem. This sounds like your problem since flourescent lites, motors, etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it, but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor. Fusebox on other side of wall maybe? We started spec'ing Panasonic CT-1331Y video monitors (3 switchable input lines(vid & aud) S-VHS on one) <$400. This stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it.  Now on to your problem. You need what is known as mu shielding (very common, in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type O'scopes). I talked to a EE prof. He said get a coffee can, cut both ends off, mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor.  BE CAREFUL TO AVOID ALL HIGH VOLTAGE CIRCUITRY. ESPECIALLY THE THICKER HIGH VOLTAGE ANODE LEAD USUALLY COLORED RED. IF YOU KILL YOURSELF, DON'T BLAME/SUE ME!!! USE PLASTIC OR OTHER NON-CONDUCTING STAND-OFFS AND SUCH TO MOUNT CAN. Now, I would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out, so hopefully this'll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well. If not, start shielding those other sources.  Jeff Babb babb@sciences.sdsu.edu   babb@ucssun1.sdsu.edu Programmer, SDSU - LARC","electronic"

If you have an idea about its voltage and current  ratings, e.g. 60VDC @ 6A, you can probably get away with replacing it with  anything with better specs.  Early MOSFETS had a gate-source voltage rating  of approximately +/- 20 VDCmax, and they would usually turn completely ""ON""  at +10VDC.  Otherwise, MOSFETS are not really mysterious -- they're more or  less voltage controlled current sources.  If the MOSFET in your circuit is  used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to  experiment with various gain-altering techniques.

I have noticed that the waveform  synthesizer that I am using (Analogic 2020) has some relatively large common mode noise on it.  I am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uV) several hundred  times.  The 2020 has about 1-3 mVp-p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat.  (The noise is not quite in sync with  line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64Hz).  How can I get rid of the noise?  When I look at the spectrum using an HP 3582A (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute I switch to  'isolation' on the input.  I am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the  input since it will read accurately down to DC.  Also, if I use a differential amplifier (IA) to solve the problem,  how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected  to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused  by different cable capacitances)?  If anyone can suggest a good IC IA for  use with transient signals with content from 1KHz to about 300KHz, I would appreciate it.  ","electronic"

I haven't been following this, so I'm sorry if somebody already mentioned   this, but you could grab a lemon (I think potatoes work too, but I'm not   sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (I think you can get the   metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  Stick the strips in   the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not   a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  As I recall we had to hook   something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of   current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a   demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)   Mark S.

So,  I'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!  	Please Explain how Watts are calculated in Audio Amp circuits. No, Not P=I*E, Just how it relates to one of the following:  	Ai [Current Gain] 	Av [Voltage Gain] 	Ap [Power Gain] 	or whatever.  I already have a ?wonderful? cheap I.E <$20 schematic for a 20W amp, but I would like to Cross/improve the circuit. The problem is that the parts list has IC1 and IC2 as NEC70001AB amplifiers. They look like ?11 pin?  SIP packages with a heatsink. This schematic was published in a 1991 mag so it may be non-existant now. Anyway, I tried looking up a replacement in the latest Digi-key Cat and found it  not listed 8(. The closes I could figure was a 9 pin SIP as TDA1520BU. Anyone got any Ideas?   	I thought, hey I can rin a PSPICE simulation using 741 opamp  models. Yea, great! It worked. But, I guess the 741 wasn't made for High power amps. As a result, I got a Voltage gain of ~15mV/V. Worse than I started with 8(... Does anyone have a PSPICE CKT file with cheap yet good gain? How about some models for some of the chips listed in this  E-mail? Any ASCII Chip info you guys can send me?   I'm open to Suggestions/Ideas/Comments/Help! Please E-mail since I have little time to search the News...  And I'll post if there's and interest!

Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however, that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet  away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding. If you experience the problem frequently, it may be  caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio  transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire, etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.  If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them). Good instructions are included with the chokes. If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  --   =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-= Randall Rhea                                        Informix Software, Inc.

There are several different speeds of SMD, and I think that the  Fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 Mb/sec (thats megabits).  There used to be several companies that made couplers for the PC (Interphase in Texas being one), but I think that the market pretty much has dried up. Controllers for this type of drive are readily available for VME buses though.  Rumor has it that there is a SMD to SCSI adapter available, but I think that it was designed for slower SMD devices.  In other words, if you have a PC or Mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat. Cheers, Corwin","electronic"

Check out Xicor's new goodie in the April 12th edition of EETimes X88C64 - an 8k * 8 E2PROM with built in latch AND bootloader setup. You hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the serial port on the '51, you load in your code via RXD, this gets blatted onto the E2PROM, then you reset and run - i'm sure Dallas also does something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative prices, and the Dallas part freeing up P0 & P2 completely.

Science Lines: 37 Distribution: usa Message-ID: <1r1099INNe68@tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu> NNTP-Posting-Host: tomato.cis.ohio-state.edu   Hi all,  I'm an assistant manager at a local art theater here in Columbus.  I'd like to expand our show automation a bit- namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up.  Our current automation consoles date from the early 60's and don't provide this function.  We already have the combo failsafe/contact rollers to read the cuetapes, and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade-up control circuit (120 VAC) is momentarily closed, for at least 0.5 second.  I've tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12V relay, activated when the cue tape completes the circuit.  Low tech and simple, but there's one problem:  In order to get the 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be a sh**load of cuetape on the film.  (35mm runs at 90 feet per minute, so to get a 1/2 second pulse, there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape!)  Ideally, I would like to use a single cross-cue to accomplish this function. (A single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film) This would give a pulse of approximately 1/100 of a second. What I need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1/2 second.  The ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice.  I figure this would require an RC circuit of some sort.  I'm sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads.  Any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated!

Sometimes two elco's in antiseries (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.  So there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost one.  Best 73's  Wouter","electronic"

Anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands. If you applied your test, all of those radar operated door openers in malls would be illegal.  One of the great problems here is that there are too many ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well be laws refereing to ""police bands"", they are almost certainly local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning, but incompetent idiots.

The noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path.  The noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high impedance audio circuits a resistive ""T"" is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers the audio.  In low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are shorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance.  Sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.  Telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to ""Make before break and Vica Versa"" but I haven't seen any of these for years.  Nowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.  A novel circuit I used to build was a primitive ""optical isolator"".. It consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is off the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio.  Once again this device in a ""T"" switches the audio.  Varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  Use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer!

The air flow of small 3.5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50% by using a 1 to 4 uF capacitor.  Use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts.  Note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application.  For DC powered applications, try the Radio Shack 12 volt box fan.

Jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor.   The results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed. The federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not.  A lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.  When you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions,  explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector. (I promise I am not making this up!)

My first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each compariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).  The first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my circuit would not detect it.     The second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv.  I am wondering if I am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work.    There are faster compariators, but they are expensive, and require  split supplies.   I would need to replace my .49 quad compariator with three 1.89 compariators, and create a whole new power supply circuit.    At this point, I think what I need is some sort of transistor circuit.  Transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...  Unfortunately, I am way out of my league when It comes to designing transistor circuits, so I am appealing to the net for help.  Any ideas, tips, circuits, pointers, references, etc. would be greatly appreciated.    Oh yes, I only sample the output of this thing every second or so, so I don't need a fast response time at all, however, I haven't found a way to take advantage of that fact.  Thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give. Of course, you will have my undying gratitude.

I am considering the use of a quadrant detector from Centronic Inc. to give information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles.  For the source I am considering wazing the heck out of an IR LED(s), possibly an Optek OP290 or Motorola MLED81.  Wazing would mean at least 1 Amp current pulses.

Hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp,  and are also unlikely to have a ""dirty"" amp.     Hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  It is very unlikely, however,    that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  Ham rigs  Not possible either.  You'd need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier.  I can just see it.  You need to slow down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.     for cars put out around 100 watts.  It is possible that a 100 watt    radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet     away.  Most TVs, stereos, and VCRs have very poor RF shielding.    If you experience the problem frequently, it may be     caused by a ham, CBer, or other radio operator in a base station    nearby.    The interference may have been caused by a radio     transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,    etc.  If you heard voices over your stereo, I think you are    correct in assuming that the source is an RF transmitter.     If you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the RF ferrite    chokes available at Radio Shack.  The interference is probably    being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can    be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).    Good instructions are included with the chokes.    If that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your    neighborhood for a radio operator.  Look for antennas on the roof    or car.  Talk to him/her about your problem.  There are things    a radio operator can do to reduce interference.  And please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator.  This person may or may not be the  cause of your troubles,  and you'll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful (most are).  It was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as I grew up.  We were blamed for skip (ghost pictures on the TV that occur at sunspot peaks),  c.b. interferance,  dead grass :),  you name it.    BTW, the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible.  It is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the FCC views it. Too bad they don't require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions.  Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.  Ham operators are required to declare their call (sign) every so many minutes (no more than 10).  So if you hear ""This is WA1QT"" or some other call starting with A, W or K and no more than 6 total characters, you heard a ham. CB'ers probably won't sign (I don't know that they're even required to) and fire/police have other private ids.       -- Douglas S. Rand <drand@osf.org>		OSF/Motif Dev.

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones (BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

Bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas LaserJets (given half-way decent toner, like HP's ""Microfine"" stuff) don't.  Both produce very good output, but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that LaserJet output is definitely superior.    On the other hand, LaserJets which haven't been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much worse than a bubblejet. :-)  One other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are BubbleJets. There are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output (such as HP's dinky little BubbleJet), whereas most produce really good looking output (such as HP's DeskJets).  IBM and Canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets.  					---Joel Kolstad  P.S. -- If you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, I can highly recommend the HP Portable DeskJet, although I've heard the portable Canons are good too (I needed PCL support, myself).

These use lateral photoeffect detectors [Lindholm and Oberg, 1974; Woltring and Marsolais, 1980] to determine the position of a spot of light projected (using a camera lens) over its surface.  In escence, the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes (one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal) and a single anode (the back of the crystal).  A spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector's face.  Let's try some ASCII graphics in 2-D (so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position)                  -------------------------> 1              |                       |              |                       |       |\            -----   cathode 1         |       |  \            XXXXX                     ________| +  \            XXXXX|                            |      \        -------     light >XXXXX|                            |        \_____ divider __ output            XXXXX|     |                      |        /      -------            XXXXX|-----| |--                  |      /           |            XXXXX|   + |    |         ________| -  /           1 + 2            XXXXX|         --- gnd    |       |  /            XXXXX|         \ /        |       |/            XXXXX| anode              |            XXXXX                     |            ----- cathode 2           |              |                       |              |                       |              --------------------------> 2  If the dot of light from the LED is the ONLY source of light, then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina- tion (the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power).  When this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light, then the way of ""tuning"" to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal, light the LED for an equal time and sample that signal separately.  The difference between the two is the position of the LED.  Hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2-D lateral photoeffect detectors, and they also sell the required signal processing electronics.  The ready-made systems by SELSPOT and others are NOT cheap ...   Lindholm, L.E., and K.E.

Umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  Some involve modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c. 	All of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time.  I recall, however, near monthly releases of new ways to ""crack"" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  The fact is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  Some are more or less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked. 	I guess what I am saying is that your question is difficult, if not impossible, to answer.  What exactly do you want to know?  Do you need a good one for a project you are working on?  How secure must it be?  Are you trying to crack one that someone else has used?  I can probably make suggestions, assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (In general, it is a BAD idea, legally, to tamper with copy protection.  It can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy protected,) which can be devestating.)  Do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications, and are merely curious? 	Please clear up those questions, and I'll try to help as much as I can.  	Incidentally, the ""Uh oh..."" at the top is indicative of the dread anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels when they are asked how to hack.  The area you are broaching is wrought with dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it (from one side or the other.)  Matt","electronic"

Ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (X-rays, cosmic rays etc).  possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up most of the UV), however since most people use UV to get other things to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not work as well, if it worked at all.

I can just see it.  You need to slow >down on a downgrade,  so you hit the push to talk button.  Now, that indeed is possible.  A good friend of mine is running about 1 KW PeP from his car.  Yes, he does have a second alternator.  Yes, he calls the rig an ""electronic brake"" since the engine noticeably slows when the key is down.  My car, unfortunately, has so much computer junk under the hood that it's astonishingly sensitive to RFI.  If I key a 2W HT over the engine with the hood open, the car loses timing due to the RF leaking into the  distributor pickup.  Very poor design.  I will, however, point out that ham radio operators are usually quite willing to help when interference is detected.  Remember that any interference is wasted power; if I put out 1W in the TV band, that's 1W that I am not putting out in the band I am trying to transmit on, and 1W can often be the difference between a nice card hanging on the wall, and nothing.  CBers, however, are usually not as helpful.  Most illegal CBers, however, will stop operation when you inform them of a problem.  The rest of them will stop operation when you inform the local FCC office of the problem (in writing, and giving details and addresses).  >Last, you can usually tell ham radio vs. CB.

Good advice.  Hams will frequently give their call, and will never use a ""handle.""

Ideally, output should be the same, but... The output value was only about 10% of the previous one!     Why? What is the nature of this output value? What does the voltmeter  actually measure?

The ""near"" means that it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength), not that it is ""nearly UV.""  (I'm sure you can figure out now just what ""far UV"" is.)  Regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of UV in the near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak UV source.  Stronger sources are going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as fluorescent tubes with UV phosphor).  Be careful, though; strong UV sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  The shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.  It wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with UV tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source.  It would be bright enough to be useful, but not dangerously so.  		-Ed Hall 		edhall@rand.org","electronic"

Strictly, a 1 of 4 decoder need only take two lines in and make one output change state, according to the inputs.  A demux, on the other hand, uses two control inputs to determine which of four outputs will reflect the state of the input signal. So there are three inputs required.  A decoder can be used as a demux if it is equipped with an output enable input, since this can be used as the data input (e.g. when high, all outputs are high; when low, only the selected (by control inputs) output will be low).  An eight way decoder is created by using the high order bit (bit 2) to select which of two four way demuxes is enabled. Thus you achieve your aim of having only one output of eight reflecting the input bits. Note that this method cannot be used to create a true eight way demux, since you have no data input (the enable line on a four way decoder) left once you commit the enable lines to their intended purpose.  A sixteen way decoder obviously requires four, four-way decoders, plus a mechanism to enable only one of the four at a time. Therefore, use the fifth decoder, attached to the two high order bits, to provide the four enable lines.  Of course, the two low order bits must be connected in parallel to the four final stage decoders.  Please give me the credit when you submit your homework.

Yes, but... the minimization of gates is important in part because of TIMING considerations.  A TTL gate has the basic structure of AND/OR/INVERT, and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly ONE gate delay.  The reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization.  	A positive-OR gate (such as the 9-gate solution uses) has TWO gate delays (and there's another gate delay in the second term) so that the second solution, while simpler in logic symbols, can  be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world. ECL is similar to TTL, in that it can support an OR/AND gate with the minimum delay (unlike TTL, you get both true and inverse outputs for 'free' when using ECL).  	PALs are basically large programmable AND/OR/INVERT gates (with your choice of internal connections between the various sections, and perhaps some latches), so a minimum sum of products ALSO is a way to shoehorn a logic design into  a few PALs.  It's not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates, but some software packages claim to allow you to do so, and will take just about any mess of gates (as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ICs) and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job.  Xilinx's XACT software does this by treating each logic block as a macro, and expanding it all out, then simplifying.  	John Whitmore","electronic"

I know all about having to pulse the signal and everything, I just have one problem:  I'm assuming I need a negative (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction  opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.  Is a negative logic high (I've seen this in schematics) the same thing as an active low, or what?  I'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how would I get a negative logic high out of this thing?  I need to have all three signals available:  Logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I always wanted to build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.  pin 1:  signal ground pin 2:  signal pin 3:  always hot +6 volts pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors  The infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  There is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5K from pin 5 to ground.  The signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in IR receiver. They use a chip called CX20106A and a BJT to amplify the signal.  I would imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use it as the external receiver.

I know no fixed version of the 6551. There are different possibilities to work around this bug. The easiest is to tie _CTS to GND and use _DSR or _DCD as _CTS. It should be easy to fix the software, _DSR is bit 6 and DCD ist bit 5 of the Status Register (Read 6551 with RS1 = low and RS0 = high).  Using the _CTS-line can lead into big trouble. The 6551 _instantly_ stops transmission if _CTS goes high. This means, that you may get only a half byte...

I wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if I were you.  If you program is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be distributing the stripped version is well under a week.  Hardware methods prevent J. Random Loser from using his Copy II PC to pirate  your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough  connections to ""real"" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your ""check for the  hole"" code.  You may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose numbers don't change with the price).  As for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  Of course, a lot of pirates just have this ""thing"" about having pirated software, even if they never use it, so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  Even so, 20% is awfully low.   					---Joel Kolstad  P.S. -- I assume you're talking PC software.

How are those orange ""isolated ground"" outlets (often used in >computer rooms) wired?    They require two separate grounds.  One ground goes to the ground pin of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal faceplate, if any).  The box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground. The outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.  So the two separate ground systems are connected together at the building's service entrance.  But one is also connected to every grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building, while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  If someone happens to accidentally short one phase of a 600V feeder to ground, the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated ground will remain relatively noise-free.","electronic"

The 2600 had some extra ASIC chips that were basically modified graphics chips and PIA's for the joysticks. Later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one ASCI, as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.  Additionally, I think the 2600 used 2K, 4K, and up to 8K of ROM for their games. I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM. Think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers. And occasionally hacking with the 2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups). Also I tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the ROM into a RAM cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to backup cartridges). I've heard of a setup like this where games could be bought (cheaply) on FSK-recorded tapes, then you would load them into a special RAM cartidge, and play them.  Anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got two 2600 machines around (one composite A/V modified), and lotsa cartridges. Willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and handling. Don't play it anymore, since going to computers + Nintendo (interested in that too?).  Hope that helps your question... I might grab some 6502's out too, since they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers). -shishin ""squish"" yamada squish@endor.harvard.edu","electronic"

The electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch. On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.  The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology.  It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer.  Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about $US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield) cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer between the two technologies.

I have noted an interesting anomality with my Alinco DR-100 2 meter ham transceiver.... It will make a *cheap* radar detector scream!  I am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)  ============================================================================== Randy T.

The hassle of photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only $15.  Also, consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for registered users.  For instance, a coffee mug.  You could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.

Not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm (tried that) but also change 8 components in the Rec/Play section to allow for the lower data rate (250kbit, not 500kbit as it was designed for) and also change the Recording Current to allow for the low data rate/rev speed!

It seems to me that when I bought my first CD player (was it REALLY 10 years ago?!), the specs said ""4 TIMES"" ...  Could someone please tell me whether I'm getting senile?  If I'm not, then what good does it do for the player to take samples at a higher rate?  If I really wanted better fidelity, wouldn't I have to have the same higher rate of sampling during the recording process?  Furthermore, am I wrong in interpreting the sampling rate (from the player's point of view) as being the same thing as the data rate for the bit stream coming off the optical medium?  Does this mean that the data rate (related to the rotational speed of the disk) has  changed since 1983?

I last used it over a month ago.  Second, as most people do...I never use the power switches on the CPU or moinitor.  I have everything plugged into a surge protector and I turn the whole shebang on with it.  Now, is this bad???  Should I quit doing it?  Is my system getting too much power or varrying power this way when activated?  Now...before I take it to a repaoir shop I want to replace the resistor to see what happens.  But I have no idea what value it is.  Or even if that would fix things..would it just blow again??  Right now, when I plug it in and turn it on I don't even get the power LED..a power supply prolem?? Should I bother tracking down this resistor value or take it to a shop??  It is resistor R830.  It's near the metal shield that shgields..something..near a large black electrolytic capacitor.  It's on the right most pc board.  The monitor is an Imtec 1455N, from mid-1989. Does someone have schematics for this?  Or would someone be willing to take theirs apart and see what value R830 is???  Basically, what the hell should I do to get this thing fixed for the cheapest amont in the least time.  I have crosposted this article.  Please respond via email with any help or suggestions.

With relays alone, you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn ON or OFF any channel.  If you don't want to hear the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing) to gently MUTE the signal, then switch, THEN remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.  	It used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  And, the devices are cheaper than relays.  	John Whitmore","electronic"

The point is that the original poster was talking about connecting ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big NO NO), and you are talking about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).  If this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the house are operating.  There should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition.

[Note: I just tried to figure this stuff out about a month ago myself, from various people on the net, so I could be wrong.]  The data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such, of course), and eventually gets turned into 44.1 KHz, 16 bit, two channel data. Oversampling takes two discrete data points, and interpolates n-1 points between them for n times oversampling.  When I asked, people said that the interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more complicated.  Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective"" sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency antialiasing filters.  For the same quality filter, higher oversampling lets you build cheaper filters, whereas for the same price filter, higher oversamplings lets you build better filters.  So, assuming the quality of all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias filtering.  					---Joel Kolstad","electronic"

I'd like to see this info as well.  As for wavelength, I think you're primarily going to find two - 880 nM +/- a bit, and/or 950 nM +/- a bit.  Usually it is about 10 nM either way.  The two most common I have seen were 880 and 950 but I have also heard of 890 and 940. I'm not sure that the 10 nM one way or another will make a great deal of difference.  	Another suggestion - find a brand of TV that uses an IR remote, and go look at the SAMS photofact for it.  You can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding specs. if the system uses that.

Are any of the inputs to the chip coming from TTL?  Standby-drain specs for CMOS chips typically apply only if inputs are pulled all the way down to zero or all the way up to Vcc.  TTL isn't good at doing the former and it won't do the latter at all without help from pullup resistors.

Yeesh, you WILL be nailing those IRLEDs.  May I suggest getting your mitts on the Siemens SFH484-2 IRLED?  This unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit.  It will output nearly a watt (975 mW) with REAL short duty cycle times.  (nice thing about the SFH484-2 is that it is CHEAP.  I got mine for about 50 cents a piece, even though I had to buy 100 of them....)  	BTW, I have seen IRLEDs with outputs up to 6 watts...honest, 6 WATTS.  I don't have the book here at work so I can't recall the company name.  The 6 watter ain't cheap, around $108 but if you want some power, mamamia, that's pretty hot.  They also have a 4 watt, a 2 watt and a 1 watt device in their line, and will sell small quan. to individuals. If you are interested, I can find the book at home and get the pertinent info.  	Now, as for the position detector, you might try ELTEC in Florida. Phone number listed in the 92/93 ETID is 904-253-5328.  They seem like  nice people.  Their specialty is passive infrared detection devices, so they might be able to help you out.  	I'm curious about your applications if you don't mind saying.

With the DeskJet >Portable, you even get an undocumented PCMCIA card slot!  I second that suggestion.  Although I don't own the HP Portable Deskjet, I *do* own the HP Deskjet 500.  It gives the nicest outputs, with only a minor loss of quality.   For all intensive purposes (papers, letters, resumes), I treat my Deskjet like a laser printer (You *do* have to look a bit closely to see the blurs in the characters).  Only one grudge, the ink that HP gives you does smudge rather quickly in the presence of moisture (Even though the ink is waterproof).  However, you would have to spend about $500 more for laser quality.  The cannon bubblejets are nice, however they don't seem to have as much support (eg: drivers for popular programs) as the HP ink-jets. Also HP Deskjet (regular,plus,500,500c) accepts xerox paper (I believe that the cut-sheet feeder is an option for the cannon bubblejet).  If you don't mind refilling your printer with cheap ink (say fountain-pen ink), then the HP deskjets are *very* cheap to maintain (I paid $3.50 for my last bottle of ink and I expect it to last 9 months).   	-Kimball (who doesn't work for HP, but just loves his printer 		  very much!)  PS: I have a question for you netters, I'm too afraid to refill with the waterproof inks they sell in art-supply houses because I had brought a bottle of waterproof ink and it clogged up my cartridge. I wonder what is a 'good' waterproof ink (aside from buying refill-kits) to refill my cartridge?    ","electronic"

Seems to me you should be able to throw a dehydrator together >for just a few bucks. Heck, the technology is only what? 1,000 years old?  You can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, ""The Hungry Hiker's Guide to Good Food,"" by Gretchen McHugh.  The heat source is a 100 watt light bulb.  Basically, it's a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air to flow).  The light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are spaced every 6"" starting about 10"" above the bulb.  Or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what I do:  Use your oven.  (NOTE - I do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting).  Put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven.  Set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  Stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows for airflow.  Leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  If you are using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway through.  If you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub for this stuff.  gerald.belton@ozonehole.com    * SLMR 2.1 * I still miss my boss, but my aim is improving.                         ---- The Ozone Hole BBS * A Private Bulletin Board Service * (504)891-3142 3 Full Service Nodes * USRobotics 16.8K bps * 10 Gigs * 100,000 Files SKYDIVE New Orleans! * RIME Network Mail HUB * 500+ Usenet Newsgroups Please route all questions or inquiries to:  postmaster@ozonehole.com","electronic"

Since we apparently don't have the sensor base you folks have, they're installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways (initial tests are going to be in the Santa Clara area I'm told), with the video being piped into a command center they're building somewhere in the East Bay.  I'm not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data, but large multi-colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway.  An announcer will sit in front of the status 'wall', and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it.  They're apparently also looking into licensing a low-AM frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system.  In the mean time, they'll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead.  My understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program, and information from it will be available free of charge.  Perhaps the LA system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate (read ""cheap"").  We also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the SAP audio channel of television channels 2 and 36.  These are verbal reports, qualified with a identification tone to tell in-vehicle receivers like the 'Auto Talk' that the information coming next is applicable to a given area.  In LA, they're probably using some other TV channels, but the concept is the same.  Try setting your stereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information. I believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle receivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly fees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers don't have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely true), they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You may have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing more, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)  I think we'd all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the LA system is networked and paid for.

One not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...  For our class project, we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs:  Voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12V Current:   *limited* at 1A  Voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for I from 0-1A AC ripple less than 5 mV (rms)  Of course, we can't just use an adjustable voltage, current-limiting regulator chip ;^)  Our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we've found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit).  What the supply must do, if presented with a load which would draw more than 1A, given the supply voltage, is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp.  Thus, if we were to short the thing with the ammeter, we should read one amp.  If we measure the current through a 1 ohm  resistor at 12V, we should read one amp (and the output voltage, by necessity, must be 1V.  The only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output  power transistor, and therefore reduce the output.  So, does anybody have any ideas we could work from?  Thanks in advance.

(Design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the MOSIS scalable design rules.) Here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:  1) They don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is 	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the 	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground 	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce.   2) They do help a lot with on-chip loads, as I had with the high load 	on the clock lines.   3) The transients you are trying to suppress are really high 	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff 	capacitors, since the RC time constant is too large. 	What I did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich, 	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent 	diff-metal1 contacts.  I forget exactly how wide the poly 	lines were.  If I were doing this design again, I'd probably 	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead, 	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high 	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).  4) You are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with 	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for 	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors. 	I had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for 	a MOSIS tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as I 	needed.

Actually detecting a BREAK is done by watching for a ""character"" containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  This means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot, which basically indicates a BREAK.  There is no special way to detect BREAK that I have found other than this -- there's no magic signal generated by UARTs, etc.  Alan Mimms (alan@apple.com, ...!apple!alan)   | My opinions are generally Portable Macintosh Software Group             | pretty worthless, but Apple Computer                                | they *are* my own...

I'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer used those little self-contained modules.  I think Sharp made them. Radio Shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)  The module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  It contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator all in a tiny metal can.  If you want to buy one, try Radio Shack, or else a TV repair shop can probably order one.

When I asked, people said that the >interpolation was not simply linear interpolation, but significantly more >complicated.  You are quite correct in your understanding.  The filtering is not interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to.  Generally, these players run the samples thru an all-pass filter network.  I have done this for ECG waveforms from a person's heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  It actually reconstructs peaks that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point.  I use a CPU to do all the math.  It takes a decent (but not unreasonable) amount of CPU time to do this.  You can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code.  In case you care, the filtering method uses an FIR (finite impulse response) filter.  I'd guess that CD makers use the same kind of method.  Anybody out there know the real answer?  I'd say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  This strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs.   >Anyway, then, the purpose of oversampling is to move the ""effective"" >sampling rate up to n times 44.1 KHz, in order to use higher frequency >antialiasing filters.

So, assuming the quality of >all other components in a CD player remained the same, oversampling should >allow a manufacturer to produce _slightly_ better sound due to anti-alias >filtering.  Actually, I think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic.  I would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not.  You can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   It's too bad that they charge more for something that (I think) is actually less costly to build.  I seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  They are built to a price spec, and that spec says ""cheap as possible!"".    >					---Joel Kolstad    -dave --  Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                         37N 17.382    121W 59.190 ","electronic"

Well, letsee (whipping out HP-48SX, soon to be GX): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5 nanoseconds resolution.  Hmm.  That'll be rather difficult!  The more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally somewhere around 40kHz.

If you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer, you will find that the spectrum power density is flat, which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.  Often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low-pass filtering a white noise signal. Therefore pink noise contains much more low-frequency components.  The effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals. An additional low-pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why.  Enjoy it.  Wouter.","electronic"

It used a 10 GHz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured. The 10 GHz was just the carrier: the real signals were several switched ones around 7.5 MHz or so, whose relative phases at the receiver would read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. The units came with psychrometers (sp?) to measure the relative humidity and instructions for correction of the measurements due to RH and temp. They were rather heavy and required an operator at each end. Current technology uses polarized reflectors, dual polaization TX/RX and psuedo-random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution at X band, much better at 47GHz.

GANDLER) writes: > >	How does the radio Electronics free information cards work. >Do they just send you some general information about the companies that >advertise in their magazine or does it also give you sign you up for a >catalog.   That depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled. Radio Electronics compiles all of the cards, then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number. Some magazines also provide the data on self-adhesive labels, and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk.  The advertiser decides what to do with the data they get. You will notice that the Radio Electronics information card (commonly called a ""bingo card"" in the industry) includes lines for a company name and a business phone number. My guess would be that the big, national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can. For example, if you include Motorola as your company and include a business phone (and a mail stop), Tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard-bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later. If you leave it blank, odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet. Medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog. And then some companies, like Digikey or Jameco, have nothing to mail out accept the catalog.  A couple of other interesting points about bingo cards: Free, industry magazines like EDN and such also log your card to their computer. They use the information at least three ways. They note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you, through repeated mailings, to re-subscribe. They also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics. This way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that ""23% of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors."" And finally, some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information. For example, Tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment OTHER THAN TEKTRONIC's, in the past 6 months.  The other point, in the data the advertiser receives, many magazines include how many items you circled on the card. If they want, the advertiser can attempt to cull out the ""literature collectors"" from the serious potential customers.  ""Can you say qualified sales leads? I thought you could.""  What's the BEST way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards?    Never circle more than 8 number on the card. If you want more   than 8 items, use the second card and mail it a couple of   weeks later.    If you are really, really serious and you really, really want   the information, CALL THE ADVERTISER AND ASK! This will also   cut about 15 days off the the response time. Virtually   everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data   on a computer printout.    To help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you're   not really ""qualified"" for, send in a bingo card at least every   other month and circle two or three numbers.    Include a business name and phone number, even if it's your house.   Advertisers almost never call.

Just a thought, you could use a roof mounted IR sender, similar in operation to a TV remote control that tells each persons coded IR pulser to send a pulse.

If you want to protect you soft, supply a >good documentation and support. This is IMHO the *only* way of effectively  >protecting software.  There are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the user is using a legitimate copy.  The simplest and virtually fool-proof way is for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on (some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different machine (NOT installed from original disks) will not work.    The program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  If the user  did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way. No document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!  I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's  conscience should do that.  I know, I'll get flamed for this...  But with the increasing number of ""casual"" users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights (It's the truth.  I have ""friends"" who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time, and when I refused, they went after somebody else.), casual pirating is becoming more of a problem.  Some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying.  I've seen what some of my ""friends"" dug up somewhere...  Latest and the greatest games, all cracked, WITHIN days of actual release!  You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  Determined pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread  that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once found by authorities.  It is the ""casual"" pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage.  What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup ""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above. Two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus violated their license agreement.  This way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal  discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.  The registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  On the other hand, the software company now have a record of where THIS particular copy is  supposed to be.  If this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not  supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  Of course, a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?  --Kasey Chang","electronic"

Also, make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger.  Another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk, just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector.   To help you here, you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph. Make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well, or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in some random sector.  Like you mentioned, there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys, but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end-user, which you is the opposite of what you want.  Another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of.  If the program does not find that this is the same system, it requests being installed by the original disk again.  The original disk should be encrypted, compacted, have many sectors that should be checked, and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied.  Once again, you MUST put code-encryption, self-rewriting code, and multiple CRC checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed.  Among other things, this also protects your program from virii.  If the program detects a change in its code, tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program.  Tell them the program is ""VIRUS SECURE"", and remember, you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses.  Feel good.  I hope that I have helped.  Have fun.  Knock some cracking out (well, you can't do it, everything that can be written can be cracked, but you'll piss'em off in the process!). Goodbye.

Phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time. A receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals. Maps can be drawn that plot the Lines of Position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two stations.   John Eaton !hp-vcd!johne  ","electronic"

Carpenter) writes: > >> I'm wondering if it's possible to use radio waves to measure the >> distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver? > >Yes. It's called RADAR. Well, actually not quite. Both Radar and Radio-Altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal, then receive its reflection from a target. Radar generally uses pulses, while Radio Altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous-wave transmission. In the case of the latter, highly accurate distance measurement can be made. As an example, the original Bendix ALA-52 Radio Altimeter was accurate to 1/8 foot at 2500 feet altitude.  Note, however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about. The problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers. This cannot be wire connected, since radio waves will actually travel faster in free-space (air, in this case) than wire (the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable). So you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance, etc. Something like a PLL connected to a GPS receiver should do the trick, triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. Sound expensive? Not too bad, but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.  Why not go to a different method? Surveyors use a laser-light system where again the reflection time is measured. Why not try this? (Sounds like something a P.E. should know about anyway ;-).  >> Seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength >> and determine distance. This would be for short distances (2000 ft), >> and I would need to have accuracy of 6 inches, or so.  This is actually highly inaccurate, since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit, there are variances in the antenna and transmission line, and the receiver may also vary, both from unit to unit, and the same unit over time. You would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. With the radio altimeter this is also done, but since everything is located at one place, it is much easier to do. Note especially that the time base for the R.A. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...  >Depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in >a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this >concept.  Nope. FM capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. That is, unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength. This is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes. Signals bouncing off runways tend to be VERY strong...  >> What frequencies would be best for this? Or does matter?  As high as possible to eliminate outside influence, and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals. Radio Altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 GHz.

This is, of course, assuming that the program uses something in ROM (like   the BIOS serial number, maybe?) and not a disk-based code number.    Obviously if the drive goes bad you'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.  I work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.    We have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred   machines, both PC and Macintosh, as well as administering a network of   over 50 NeXT machines.  I personally am concerned only with a small lab   with ten PC's and ten Mac's.  (I'm not the manager, but help him with   admin often).  IMHO, copy-protection schemes of ANY sort are nothing more   than a major headache for the legitimate user.  Anyone who wants a copy of   your program and doesn't care about legality will get a copy.  Period.    ""Pirate board"" or no pirate board.  I too have ""friends"" who blatantly and   quite successfuly ""hack"" copy protection schemes practically in their   sleep.  Let's consider what goes on in our lab.  Almost daily we have at least one   machine down, sometimes several, due to some goofball screwing up some   setting or other on a piece of software.  Admittedly, we (being students,   mostly) are not the world's most efficient and effective network   administrators, but we try.  Keeping even the twenty machines that are   (partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and ""acting"" similar to   the average user, and maintaining ""behind-the-scenes"" consistency is a   real headache, but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty   different folder locations of Norton Utilities when some guy trashes his   disk.  Often we have hardware problems at peak ""business"" times and have to do   some parts-swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .  Well, I'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..  The point is, often we have to re-install software and copy configuration   files etc. from machine to machine.  By far the easiest way we have found   to do this is to get ONE machine working EXACTLY the way we want to, then   COPY the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that   machine's type).  This ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have   ten IDENTICAL machines to work with.  Having them networked simplifies   this considerably, as our major packages (WordPerfect, Windows, etc.) are   all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.  Often, however, we need to install a package requested by some instructor   to one, some, or all of the machines for a special project.  This is   usually a hand-written or shareware,etc. program similar to what I believe   the original poster was asking about.  The few we have had with ""copy   protection"" schemes have caused nothing but NIGHTMARES for us to maintain    . .  In short, don't waste your time with a copy protection scheme.  It's sort   of like outlawing guns.  The criminals will get your program anyway, and   you will only be hurting the legitimate, honest user.  Write a good user's   guide and tech manual, whatever else for your program (PLEASE do this   REGARDLESS of whether you copy protect the thing!!!), and only distribute   the manual to LICENSED users.  Jack the price to cut your losses, but   please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the   costs of illegal copies far better than you) and don't burden the   legitimate user with a ""copy protection"" scheme!

It could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered by moisture or damp air, which would short out the terminals.  The same thing happens to my car (Citroen 2CV) -- damp gets under the bonnet (US: ""hood"") and shorts the spark-plugs to earth so it won't start.  The solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with WD-40 (moisture repellant).  If damp *is* the problem, then storing the  battery off the ground may help.

In storage, either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance I'd ever do that at home), or the battery should be stored on a trickle charge.  I have also (I think) read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a LONG period of time. The refernce I remember is to use C/50 (where C is the amp hours) as the charging circuit, and leave it hooked up for weeks.  Some of this may only apply to Gel type cells, but I suspect the same applies to the liquid type.  Richard Dell ","electronic"

It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood): the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list that as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware the 2600 possessed.  There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.

ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari (and others) made much of these ""huge"" cartridges.  >I have no idea how much RAM it had to work with, but I >would hazard a guess of 2 or 4K RAM.   Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the bottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.  As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line to the cart.

It has been a while since I knew the electronics of ham radio, but I seem to remember that PeP is actually 4x the ""real"" power.  Which makes 1KW PeP actually around 250W.  Or was it 2x?  I disremember.  ""Effective transmitted power"" is also ""odd"", in that it takes into account antenna height and geometry.

These devices range from fully functional to having a fault which remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer.  My query is: is there anybody in Australia interested in buying them?  I think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them O/S. (Certainly the mainframes, but if you're willing to pay shipping, I'll consider offers for individual plug-ins).

All bar one of these are operational - that one failed and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.  The 7A22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high- and low- pass filters. There is _nothing_ on the market, to my knowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.

Didn't know about it being called the 6526 - thats the CIA found in the Commodore 64 (I don't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around). The TIA was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in the bottom 128 bytes of page 1. To get an image on the screen, you had to wait until the raster line your picture started at, load bitmaps for this line into the 'sprite' registers, tell them what x positions to take, how many duplicates you wanted, etc, then do it all again for the next line. This took all of the processor's time during the visible portion of the display.  >There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage >regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.  The RAM was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0, and shadowed in page 1. The 6502 has a zero-page addressing mode on most instructions that is both shorter and faster than the normal ones, so it is important on a machine like this to have the scratchpad RAM in page 0. Unfortunately, it also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits, and the high byte of the address is hardwired to 1).  The IOT section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit I/O registers (can't remember if each bit could be independantly set to I or O like the 6522 and 6526), and 1(?) 8(?) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (I think this was some power of 2). There were no interrupts in the system, so many games would set up the timer at some known time, go away and do something else for a while, then sit and wait for the timer to run down.  There was no logic in the box to do address decoding - the RIOT had at least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high, one active low), and I imagine the TIA was much the same. Various address lines were fed directly to chip selects. The 6507 likes to have ROM right at the top of memory, so the 2600 had to use ROMs with active high chip selects - not exactly normal, so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select.

Hmmmmm.... >   There is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound, or in your words, ""it DOES have a bearing on...."".  Now, I don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan, but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  And since junction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental effect on linearity.    a few facts: -bias points vary with temperature -junction resist varrie with temp -Adcom products do NOT run class-A  If you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements for most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier warm-up.  On many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for the output stage, many hours for the drivers.  Fortunately the drivers are not switched.  In any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening, betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias (idle current) level.  Both have a positive correlation with low distortion and ""good"" sound quality, and high bias results in warmer operation, all other factors being equal.  Grant  ","electronic"

Also, exact part |> numbers/company names etc. for the relays will help!  The first step is to make sure that there is no DC component, intentional or not, on the audio lines to be switched. If neither the output or input presents an unintentional DC level (let's say they're capacitively coupled), then putting a 22 K resistor from each input to ground, and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a DC level that is GUARANTEED to cause a click.  If the device presents an unintentional DC level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage, then you need to remove the DC before switching with coupling capacitors of your own.  If you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input through to a common output), you can use make-before-break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change. This may mask the switch click.  An audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto-isolator with a light-dependent resistor (LDR) sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. Many broadcast consoles use this older, but time-honored technique. Claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this, but I don't have a part number handy. Radio Shack has a LDR grab-bag (276-1657) you might want to try.  For a simple, solid state clickless switch that is cheap, you might try  looking at the CD4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its older predecessor, the 4016). Again, the DC component must be removed prior to switching. Other alternatives include JFET switches (both discrete and IC) and diode switching (which works relatively well, surprisingly). All the above, with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi-page article.  Solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state. Techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch, differential switching, and slowing the risetime of the control pulse. With the 4016, cutting the click can be as simple as putting 10K - 47K resistors in series with the control pins.  Hope this helps at least get you started.  --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

I upgraded my motherboard last fall.  I would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because I changed motherboards.  	Any info in the BIOS is too volatile to use as a checksum.  Are you going to require that a user re-install all their software if they add 4Mb of RAM to their computer?  I did that a couple of weeks ago.  It's in the BIOS, and if software had told me ""this isn't the machine you installed me on"" I would never have used that software again.  Really bad idea.  > I did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  The user's  > conscience should do that.  	This is silly.  It's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk, and then give them that.  Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.  > You know how many bytes you need to change in X-wing to disable > the quiz?  TWO!  Yes, TWO!  (And don't ask me which ones they are.)  	Do you know any assembly language at all?  All anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz, and insert a JMP instruction to just completely skip it.  Not that difficult, really!  And there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.  Using PKLITE or some similar utility would help, but only if the resulting compressed .EXE were tagged as uncompressable.  > What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus > a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup > ""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.  	This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.  Making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. But, the determined ones are just going to answer ""Joe Blow"" to the question of ""what's your name"" so this won't stop them in the long run.  	Pirates are always going to win this fight.  They simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme.  -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu  Ask me about Linux, the free 386 unix!","electronic"

Your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base  drive. In order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on  the current sensor.  Normally a darlington on the current sensing  resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense  the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to  turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  Phase compensation  may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more  than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain OK??  dino@inqmind.bison.mb.ca The Inquiring Mind BBS, Winnipeg, Manitoba  204 488-1607","electronic"

Original and older boards were bakelite composition, and were brown. Phenolic (spelling) was a tan Most ""non filled"" fiberglass boards used in computers are green. Filled fiberglass is blue. Teflon is white.  As boards evolved more and more demands were made of them.  First boards were used mainly in audio circuitry.  Couldn't be used in high voltage or RF because it would arc and burn.  Most boards today are fiberglass, the type being chosen by its use and cost.    Boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the fiberglass, and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a  capacitive dialectric, but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the high frequencies.  Another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses.  Camcorders use this to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.

What if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address  data.

Sheesh.......  It's not the temperature, it's the karma.  You see, dirt has good karma, since it's all organic and full of living things, but cement is all squared off and artificial looking, and has lost its karma in the process.  Being a karma sink, it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no longer able to keep a charge.  Because wood is also good and organic, putting a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.  The Buddha-nature is in the acid, but it is also in the lead plate.  The novice asked the master whether the spongy lead had more of the karma or whether the solid lead had it.  The master handed the novice a 250V B battery, terminals downward, and thus the novice was enlightened. --scott","electronic"

Information of how to build an EEPROM cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.  Since you've chosen the 27C512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'. To do this simply: 1. Load the game images into the EEPROM at $2000, $4000, etc. (Your EEPROM burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps.) 2. Wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console, and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.  To directly answer your question above, the pin that 'kicks up the address' is simply another address line.  For a concrete example, with the 27C512 and 8K games images, you would wire A0-A12 to the cartridge, and A13-A15 to 3 switches.  The 3 switches would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the EEPROM.

I know exactly which two bytes need to be changed, I have the code to do them too.  I just said ""Don't ask me which ones.""  I didn't say I don't know what that means.  Such hacking can be EASILY discouraged by adding anti-patching code which does a self-check upon execution and refuse to load if CRC does not match value stored (encrypted, of course) in the program.  It could be claimed as a part of anti-virus code, and it would not be far from the truth.   > >> What I believe the companies should do is implement the above plus >> a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup >> ""REGISTERED TO XXXXX -- address, city, state zip"" and disables the above.   > > This is by far the best idea you presented in your post.

The purpose of copy protection is to discourage casual pirates (""Oh, can I have a copy of that?""/""Sure, here."") and the less sophisticated pirates (""Let's look for all those calls to INT13H..."") .  Any one determined enough to break copy protection can and will succeed.  They can always backtrace the entire load-sequence of the program.  The point of copy protection is to make such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses (or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use.  Pirates who see copy protection as a challenge love breaking them, and no amount of copy protection will stop them, but the rest of us WILL be stopped.

The concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead-acid battery self-discharges at a slightly faster rate. That's why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast ---- it insulates the battery thermally. It you'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam, it will self-discharge even slower. The best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly, but also trickle-charge it every couple days too to ""shallow- cycle"" the charge in the battery. Such mild ""exercising"" of a lead-acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage. If you do remove the electrolyte, may sure you keep separate storage containers for each cell's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells when you refill the battery. This isn't so critical for a brand-new battery in a fully charged state, but will maximize the restored output of an older battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for    storage. --  ============================================================================= Neal Howard   '91 XLH-1200      DoD #686      CompuTrac, Inc (Richardson, TX) 	      doh #0000001200   |355o33|      neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org 	      Std disclaimer: My opinions are mine, not CompuTrac's.

However, you would have been better off leaving them outside. Keeping them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside. A warm battery will self-discharge faster than a cold one.  When you are storing a battery it's a good idea to charge it once a month.

I admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving' copies of programs to one's fellow workers, maybe taking it home for use on one's own PC, but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole- how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks?  It's mostly a matter of convenience: a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since ""someone's already paid for it"", etc., etc. (A note: this is starting to change a bit. not much though.)  >If you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, I bet that anything that >will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will >suffice.  what about commercially available copy programs? CopyII? how about programs like teledisk, that can do things diskcopy can't? and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldn't know about this:   after working with people around computers, one comes to realize that the 'average' user doesn't know much. Any computer enthusiast is at least 200x better at pre-guessing commands and how to use them (can *you* sit down and use something without reading the manual?) and it is these people who are doing the '20% pirating', not Joe Windows User who can't remember a few arguments to the dir command.  >I hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not* >because I want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and >and convenient than sifting through an old book I can't find.  really? I find it evens out- the online stuff can be read through faster, but you're stuck reading it in linear flow: start to finish, unless you jump ahead with a search or such. A book, though, you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too!  But I partially agree: I often wish I could grep something that was written down.  >Off deeper end-> Why does everyone think they need to be able to make a  >backup copy?

Tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point.  I have yet to chose a tracking  method.  The initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage.  I did some experiments with  pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition.  And dancers stand still alot, so their IR signature goes away.  The good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional  to the size of the warm body (or body part), and the velocity of said body. This could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.  Dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their  bodies, but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.  The current toy I have been working with is a program called Mandala for the Amiga, used with a LIVE! video digitizer.  This works with a video camera  trained on the stage.  You can set thresholds for a zone within the field of view, and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. Events can be MIDI objects or sequences, Amiga sounds or graphic objects.  It's been fun to play with, but the documentaion is arcane, and the digitizer is noisy. Still, it's very appealing, the dancers don't have to wear any appliances, you can have ots of zone,s, it speaks MIDI, which can be used to control lights, and I don't have to build any electronics.  It's all done with lighting and video brightness and contrast adjustments.  I have yet to do anything particularly useful or artistic, but I have hopes... ","electronic"

The transformer is just that - a  transformer.  It's there primarily to step the voltage up or down.  (Although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is NOT negligible, as anyone who's zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a ""snubber"" diode across it would tell you.  Actually, many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in.)  The basic switched-mode power supply operates something like this (in a somewhat simplified manner):  The AC line is rectified to produce a high voltage, more-or-less unregulated DC rail.  The energy storage (or ""filter"") caps appear across this rail, as does the switching transistor. The transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer, resulting in stepped-up or stepped-down pulses out the secondary, which  are then rectified and filtered.  At least one of the transformer's outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor, which acts in a ""pulse-width modulation"" (PWM) fashion to control (by varying the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary, and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary.  The remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will, more-or-less tracking the regulated output, or they may have some additional linear regulation added.  You may also note that the feedback between the  regulated output and the PWM control (which is most typically an IC) is not done via a direct electrical connection; this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated.  Often, the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement.  While the transformer isn't the primary energy-storage device in these designs, this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored; besides the inductive ""kick"" giving the switch transistor a bad time (as noted above), you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went *in* to the transformer back *out* again, one way or another. In some designs, this happens more or less automatically - but in others, you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn't saturate, which again would have disastrous results (best left to the  imagination! :-)).  I'm NOT by any stretch of the imagination a power-supply designer;  hopefully, a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above.

The problem is that lead-acid cells self discharge over time. Even high quality cells (Gates for instance) will discharge 50-60% over a 3-5 month period of time. Non-sealed cells self discharge even faster.

A cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of  that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print?

Long term the laserprinter  will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that  are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.  HP inkjets understand PCL so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the  software package has no inkjet driver.   There is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a  page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer.

When will people learn!  The trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows Ballast  resistors are used to discharge batteries. Furthermore it is very silly to  store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to  contact the ballast.   Seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary  greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. I have in  fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full  charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.  If your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above  freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). Occasionally charge it (once a  month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger,  DON'T do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).  Anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like  electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep  discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. Some early zero maintenance  automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure  shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb.

Of course, your control (logic) input must use -8V as the logic LOW and +8V as the logic HIGH reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic must be 4000 CMOS with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the control logic.

How could I do this? I don't want it just to turn on, I want it to 'strobe' once so to speak, per every beep I put on a cassette tape.        Would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette, or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency? Is there any easy way to do either of these? I'm looking for  the simplest circuit possible. I guess what I'm asking for is some sort of color organ, but not quite. Let me trt to explain again...        I'm going to have a pattern of beats (or beeps) on a cassette tape. So on the tape you'd hear:   beep! (pause) beep! (pause) beep! (pause)..etc.  , with speed increasing as time goes on. I want to synchronize an LED ( probably two of them) with the beeps on the cassette tape. So the LED, with each beep, would go on and off real quick, generating a strobe light sort of effect. The rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the LEDS. And if there was no sound on the tape (except for background his), the LEDs would remain off.

Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the boards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards could all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution, though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't decide to talk at the _exact same time_.  Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to ""something"" that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it used to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS or slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex the data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first paragraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)

Paying a tape is playing a tape.  There is no difference whether the  output goes to a second VCR or to a TV.  (How the VCR or TV reacts to  this signal is a different story - see messages pertaining to macrovision  copy protection.)  In order for the tape to self-destruct, it would have to have circuitry  of its own within the tape case.  The circuit would have to somehow  magically determine what the output of the VCR is connected to.  The  circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.  It is a pretty lame scare tactic.  (I've seen something similar on a BBS.

Charlie Brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  Note, though, that you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.  The things are easy to dismantle.  The key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when the camera is made.  So no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  It's standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.  All the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin, and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another.  If you take it apart yourself, you get an AA alkaline battery (still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera.

Some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.    One year, I left the batteries in the garage.  The garage is Unheated.   They were left in their places that they needed to be.  One in the riding lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle.  The battery in the  riding lawnmower was about 3-4 years old, and one of the cycle batteries  was new, and one was around 5 years old.  Upon spring time, I discovered that all of the batteries were dead, and needed to be recharged.  They all worked properly, except for the older ones, and they had to be replaced  about halfway through the summer.  (they had originally been stored in the garage, and I think I remember my dad charging them in spring)   Last year, I decided to bring them in to the basement, which has two parts. one is dirt and brick, and the other is concrete.  I brought in all three, and discovered in the spring, (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries dead, but when I put the charger on them, the charger said ""HMMMMMMMM"" and  the amp-meter read around 1,000,000,000  (In other words, it was pinned) the internal circut tripped, and I went on to the other batteries.  They were the same.      Realizing that we still had 2 GIGANTIC sailboat batteries, also lead acid, I decided to put the charger on them.  (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years, on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only needed a small charge, around 2 hours or so on trickle.  I tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts, and they worked fine for around 25 of 'em.    This leads me to believe one of several things.      1) I bought really #$%tty batteries last year. (sorta true)      2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the         batteries.      3) There was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the            room where the concrete is,       4) The dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air          better than concrete.  (BTW, I can almost waterski in the dirt room)       Any other ideas?     *could be the aliens, anything is possible.*  ","electronic"

Uh, Bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature?  On the time scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it's sitting on.  >... Question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the  >surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?  Because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss.  You're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object (your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  In the case of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final temperature.  For the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze. --  SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry","electronic"

CMOS or TTL gates provide the SIGMOID somewhat-linear-yet-somewhat-limiter transfer function often used.  Low power Schottky gates, and earlier gates, has about a gain of X8. LEDs probably output enough light to easily control CdS cells, even at a few mA. And paper with dark and light regions, controlled by pencil and eraser, could also control CdS resistance. The very high input resistance of CMOS gates may let you charge up 1uF paper/mylar caps to serve as memory.  Allen Sullivan","electronic"

Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20 kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide).   White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as ""1/3 octave"" or ""1/2 octave"" or some such terminology).  White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies (at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise, has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3 db/octave).  --  |                Dick Pierce                | |    Loudspeaker and Software Consulting    | | 17 Sartelle Street   Pepperell, MA  01463 | |       (508) 433-9183 (Voice and FAX)      |","electronic"

Withrow Associates, 21 Railroad Ave, Swampscott MA 01907-1821 USA  For those who are interested, the FCC does indeed care about cable leakage, particularly into the aviation nav band, or leakage that is ""causing interference to other services"".  Part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage, and measurement technique.  If you will clearly document your problem, and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the normal approach, remember to correct between measurement data and microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to Mr. John Wong Cable Branch, FCC 1919 M st. NW Wash DC, and a copy of your letter to the local cable company, you will get results.  In fact the cable company will probably start treating you much better when they realize you have figured out how to get the FCCs attention.  What is important is to document your case as it relates to the applicable rules.  However the cable company *is required* to at least check out every complaint of leakage.  They must file with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement report that details the results of leakage testing.  But remember, call the cable company first, and give them a chance to work to correct the problem before contacting the commission.  I am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via the airborne method.  --  SCOTTCR@WKUVX1.BITNET aka Chris Scott-                   Telco: (502) 745-3834 ","electronic"

(b) See FCC Information Bulletin, ""Subliminal Projection"" (sic, at least in my rules service copy of the rules), dated November 1977.  Since I don't have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information Bulletin around, I can't tell you what you can't do on TV ( or radio) but I seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s.   Practically speaking, I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits in MTV promos,  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such, but maby that's just because the contrast between the single frame and the surrounding material was significant.  I never believed in the one-frame type of SP being real.    On the other hand, the Coca-Cola or Brand (insert desired name here) beer cans conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched, that's another story, and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer company for the privilege of doing that, there has to be a ""Promotional Consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program; but if the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company and didn't get any of the payment for ""brand visibility"" that the film company got, then they don't have to run the message. >  >       A few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency > re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape > with single-frame messages.

I asked a professor that question just last week and he didn't really know himself.  Since pink noise is believed to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the Silicon where there's a lack of a covalent bond) that act as ""traps"" to nearby elecrons, and since this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't able to ""trap"" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  It seems to me that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  I have seen the ""pink noise"" feature, however, on many EQs, and I was wondering how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to ""man made noise"" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  If you have any information about this, it would be appreciated.

I got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago.  	I've been a happy HP user of the DeskWriter for Macintosh for past 5 years. I got one just a few months after their release. And I got software revision 1.0a (now I'm up to rev. 3.1. Our family (sister and father) have each purchased their own DW's after seeing mine go for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty ImageWriter II's). The original DW has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. I would say that it has gone through at least 15,000 sheets, and around one (small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.  	My brother might take this DW now (I'm probably gonna give it to him), and I am looking to upgrade to a color DW. The chief advantages/disadvantages I've found over the years are:  Advantages:	Quick (2-3 ppm), Quiet (roomate can sleep while it's printing), AppleTalk Networkable (unfortunately the original wasn't, so look out if you buy used. I rewired our home with phonenet AppleTalk connectors, and while home, we can all use my dad's one DW!), and cheap (now run ~$300). BTW, you can upgrade older DW's to color or for appletalk, I dunno if HP still does the upgrades, but I received many offers (I just didn't ned it however). Also, crisp laser-quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those ImageWriter Dot-Matrix people so much so, that I had to charge $0.25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night....)  Disadvantages.	Ink used to be hard to find, and wasn't cheap, and wasn't originally water-proof. While HP has done wonders with the ink (I dunno if it's still toxic), it is still subjet to smearing and running (if you run around in the damp Boston rain, and get your bookbag completely soaked). Ink now runs about $14-$15 for small carts (I get mine from Elek-Tek in Chicago, I think they're now down to $12). The ink carts used to say they're dated for only 6 months, but I don't think they say so anymore. We stick to a 4 month supply (of about 3 carts). We use cheap Hammerhill Laser Print paper (after fooling for a long time. Laser/Xerox paper is also good). Smearing doesn't happen, unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine. Other disadvantages are : No Postscript (this can be an advantage in speed, usually). Ways around this are Ghostscript or Freedom of Press software solutions. I bet HP probably has a PS prototype inkjet, but they won't release it for fear of hurting LJ sales.  In the end, the primary advantages of laser are true postscript (unless you go for cheap lasers), and fused toner (no smearing, even when soaking in water). Lasers are slightly sharper, but the only instance where I needed precise layouts was Printed Circuit Board Transparencies for PhotoEtching. I found a Textronix color Phaser Postscript (Thermal Wax Transfer) to work the best to make PCB negatives directly onto a transparency.  Well, hope my babbling has helped. -squish@endor.harvard.edu ","electronic"

True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.

It's a little costly, though.  Personally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program.  					---Joel Kolstad ","electronic"

Tip is the GREEN wire of most standard phone lines. They two constitute the two wires most often used for voice telephone (the two live lines). They are the two innermost connectors of an RJ-11 phone jack.  Another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from RED to GREEN (ring to tip. tip/green being at ground potential of the voltmeter), it should read -48 volts in the on-hook no-ring position). I am 98% sure it's -48 V and not +48 volts. Doesn't hurt a phone too much if they're reversed, it's just bad if one happens to somehow get grounded to earth ground elsewhere).  Additionally, when off-hook, the voltage drops to about -4 to -9 Volts DC. I think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 mA current loop. And lastly, when ringing, the two wires develop an AC potential of about 80 V p-p at 20 to 30 Hz across them (where you get the electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).

They cost ~$1 at Radio Shack (much cheaper in quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (I think Forest Mims has one at Radio Shack). You'll have to toy with resistor/capacitor values OR you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies. Any engineer worth his salt, can make a 555 osciallator... It's in the book, and left up to you to see (I hate doing ASCII circuit graphics). The 555 can accurately go from a few Hz to about 500 KHz (I think).  About the Tape Recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a DATA line (for flashing LED), and one as audio line (for voice or music). This would eliminate a lot of noise.  The data line is probably most easily done by some kind of PLL or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). The 565 chip is a good PLL, and not hard to work with. However if you nothing about how a PLL works, I suggest you don't try this. Op-Amp information can also be found in the Forest Mims Radio Shack info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with. Setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so I would suggest the 555 method firstmost... I have no idea what this is going into, so I am really generalizing...  As for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, I suggest you breadboard the thing... No need to solder. Wire-wrap would be the next, more permanent step. And lastly, soldering/PCB making. Hope that clears things......  -squish@endor.harvard.edu ","electronic"

Note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water at 25 C), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (I am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but I may be wrong.  Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel like thinking through it right now.)   What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be, is exothermic, or energy discharging.  If moisture with dissolved electrolytes (acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals may form.  This will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds. The reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery charger) is put back into the battery.   Lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  Each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  The non-reacting posts (terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric energy during a discharge (or charge).  Because the reaction is exothermic, it has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  So while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.   To understand why lead-acid batteries DO INDEED discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall LeChatelier's Principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position.  Here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials:                                                 thermal conductivity        material           Temperature, C (F)  BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft)        --------           ------------------  -------------------- diatomaceous earth,            204                   0.051  natural, across strata        871                   0.077 diatomaceous, natural,         204                   0.081  parallel to strata            871                   0.106 diatomaceous earth powder     (100)                  0.039   (density, 18 lb/cu.ft)      (200)                  0.042                               (300)                  0.044                               (400)                  0.048                               (500)                  0.051 concrete (cinder)              ---                   0.20          (stone)               ---                   0.54          (1:4 dry)             ---                   0.44 pine (across grain)             15                   0.087    (parallel to grain)          21                   0.20 oak (across grain)              15                   0.12 maple (across grain)            50                   0.11   Note that the thermal conductivity for ""dirt"" (diatomaceous earth) goes down with temperature.  Also, 204 C is about 400 K, and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  The thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4 times greater than wood.   It is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  At any instant the discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity or heat.  (Thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 BTU/(hr-ft-ft)(F/ft).) During storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  The higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface.  Thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature, the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt.   This is where LeChatelier's principle comes into play.  Removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  If the reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  A concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  Store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which ""pulls"" the reaction along.   Also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water.  This will tend to drive the discharge reaction.

Not all > of us have about 200 floppies around for backup, you know.    	Actually, no I don't have a tape drive.  In the event of a total hard disk failure, I reinstall the apps from originals, and restore the data from the backups I keep of that.  With upwards of 100Mb of stuff on my hard disk, there is no way I'm going to try and back it all up without a tape drive. :)  Would be nice to have one though!  > RAM is something you add all the time, so no.  It's more like BIOS > manufacturer and/or processor type (386/486/etc).  Data cannot be used, > esp with these new Flash ROM BIOS machines with updates on a diskette.  	Maybe, maybe not.  Today it doesn't happen as often (I would hope), but then if a BIOS is buggy and the user gets an upgrade, the BIOS information is going to change, at least the date anyway.  Tagging the BIOS manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard.  This type of upgrade doesn't require a hard disk backup/restore.  > On the other hand, to make this LESS intrusive it could be disguised as > ""Please Insert Original Disk #XX as I need file YYYYYY for update"".  :-)  > It would be perfectly reasonable...

Your scheme isn't going to stop anyone.   > Of course it is easier.  Are you saying then the originals SHOULD allow > only one install?  What is your point?  	Of course not.  If something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled, the *worst* thing I want that software telling me is ""this software has already been registered to <blank> and it is against the law to install it on other machines.""  Or something similar; Access for Windows does this and it only requires a click on ""OK"" to go away.  Pretty non-intrusive, but it gets the point across.  > What I said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the > restrict-to-one-machine) UNTIL the program is registered with the > manufacturer.

This is a great idea.  I like the key system that some shareware products use.  The only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost-ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.  -- Steve Madsen sjmadsen@nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu  Ask me about Linux, the free 386 unix!","electronic"

I am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an ADC and then comparing it with the AC voltage (converted to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. However, I am leary of this method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b) creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire AC line. I realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference, but that would require more parts and boost the price further. 	Someone mentioned to me that they had seen an IC which input 8 bits of data and DIRECTLY scaled the AC voltage coming in all on-chip. Unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer; if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me. 	I am building this project as a ""dimmer box"" for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). Therefor, if each box costs $150, I doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 = $2400) for sixteen channels... This is something I have noticed about today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive! 	Anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!

Silver-solder, when exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field, will actually grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. For this  reason, silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies. Fortunatly, tin-lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites as fast as silver-solder. Therefore, it is used extensively.    Jerry Long  long@spk.hp.com **************************************** Disclaimer....

Older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer.  I don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your nearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.  HP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no soldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP service center for further information.  The PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from the PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser printers.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material difference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously slow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect works, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.  The PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for its internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.  A single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer has completed its warm-up cyle.  Until ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely. Chosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the problem.  Laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges, mitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste could use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing stand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet IV.  Kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image drum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice print engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system.  The recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are subject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper. The paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is almost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable, though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician. I have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.  It depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted, the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.   --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED","electronic"

The green layer is a solder-mask, and is used to make a finished board look neat, and to avoid solder bridges, especially when using wave soldering (or any other mechanized approach). I've seen red mask, but most that I've seen are green.  A bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask is put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side (or just one side) of the board. A fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green solder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass board with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour. Teflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.  I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're not about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requires a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. A lot of companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a real boardhouse.   ","electronic"

You'll probably find that it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't being used.  A couple of cables and you're in business.  Another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with HD and VD outputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed HD and VD to the cameras.

Do I have to register to be able to get rid of it?  (Hell, no, that is the last thing I would think of!) If that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!   A better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (IMHO) to allow anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some additional features enabled.  It could mean only one new .EXE file needed to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program. Of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever time they like.  Still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .EXE file around.  That could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.   As for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions: Limit the size of data that the program can work with, Disable saving the data, Print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as such) Let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started and/or exited  etc.... but DON'T have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.    -- einari@rhi.hi.is","electronic"

Thanx in advanced.  ----------> The whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.  Class D amps *are* PWM (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like switching power supplies. I think I've seen these things called ""class S"" before as well. They're capable of very high efficiencies, and would be suitable for very high power. I've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile amp, though.  I've been trying to design a three-kilowatter for the last year (to be used as an inverter for an UPS), but have been having serious problems with layout parasitics (10 IRF 450's in parallel... any help  with a  do-able isolated drive ckt would be appreciated :) )   I'm not absolutely positive about this, but I beleive a 'class G' amp is one that operates off a variable- or switched power supply rail voltage. The Carver amps do something like this. They use some sort of phase-control circuit  (I do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size, and I beleive that is patented. I had an M400 apart (trying to fix) and found that it had three rail voltages that it switched between. I ran a simulation on PSPICE and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat) under large-signal conditions, or when driving reactive loads (which draw high current at the zero-voltage crossings).

First:  I found by poking around the windings on that assembly, the thing would make noise.  I guess that there was enough of a potential in that assembly to leak, so I sprayed it with a dielectric insulation spray--I think it was urethane or acyrilic.  That fixed it.  Second:  Flyback...for the life of me, I can't isolate this one.  If I leave the cover off, the TV will be quiet.  If I put the cover back on, and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the cover on!! :-(  A friend of mine who used to fix TV's says there might be a pin-hole leak somewhere on the flyback.

I vaguely remember a few years ago, when ""Deutsche Bundespost"" split into Postdienst, Postbank, and Telekom there was some discussion about a new regulation. I know that cordless or cellular phones still have to be approved by the Telekom, but does that hold true for regular phones? In my areacode in Germany (2234 - Frechen, near Koeln) you can use touch-tone dialing. I assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively set to pulse dialing. Last time I checked (Jan '93) the Cologne areacode 221 was still solely pulse dialing.  BTW, touch tone does become more common in Germany, bringin with it the flourishing of 1-900 services (in Germany 0190).

The material used to make them goes by two names.  If it is used to make circuit boards it is called FR-4.  The same material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a structural material and is called G-10.  FR-4 and G-10 are both green.  They are not green because of a solder masking agent.  The basic ingredients are a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  I am not sure what the specs are on the resin, but if you are really curious you can call NEMA (National Electronics Manufacturing Association) or Ciba Geigy (a major manufacturer of epoxy resins) to find out.

There are about 45 CD-ROM disks and a 4-disk changer hooked to a dedicated MS-DOS computer.  It contains scanned images of data book pages for several thousand parts.  When you ask it for something it knows about (mostly active IC parts), it works quite well. THey don't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist. It is definately a start in the right direction, but they need to expand the data base to handle more types of stuff.  These systems aren't cheap.  We paid about $7,000 for the liscence and get monthly updates of some of the CD-ROM disks.  We send the old ones back to them so that they will keep sending us the updates.  I think we pay a yearly maintainence fee of about $1,500 to get the updates.  If you find the part you want, you can look at the data sheet on a page-sized monitor (it's a special monitor from SigmaSystems).  You can also print each page of the datasheet you want on a LaserJet printer.  Page printing takes a couple of minutes per page.  It can take a while to dump the 5 or 6 pages you usually need.  I have a feeling the maker wouldn't like it if we made the data available to all Internet users.    :-)    -dave  --  Dave McMahan                            mcmahan@netcom.com                                         37N 17.382    121W 59.190 ","electronic"

Oh well, I don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and I don't feel >like thinking through it right now.)  The major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an ACID solution. PbSO4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  Also, H2SO4 is in a water solution as 2H30+ and SO4--.  Thus the heats of formation of PbSO4 and H2SO4 are for the most part irrelevant.  >What is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be, >is exothermic, or energy discharging.  As it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing). (More about this later.)  What actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this: (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course) The battery slowly self discharges.  As this discharge takes place two things happen. -The level of Pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead            and lead oxide plates are dissolved).         -The level of H30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution            becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like). Now, as the post to which I am responding correctly stated, PbSO4 will precipitate in a WATER (non-acid) solution.  When the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged) we end up with a high concentration of Pb++ and SO4-- in water.  So PbSO4 forms in the solution and FALLS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BATTERY (of course this happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).  The precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  If there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.  I have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they are for the most part useless.  They can dissolve the PbSO4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  You may have some success with these products for a newer battery.

This stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid. In fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures.  A logical consequence of the above argument is this: ""If you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to  -50 to 'pull' the reaction along.""  We all know from experience (at  least those of us in Canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is not true.  If we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery.  (Besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge  to appreciably raise the temperature.  The air would amply dissipate any  such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  This  is of course irrelevant, since you would WANT the battery to be cool  during storage.)  Just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged! ","electronic"

Well these things seem to be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  Trimmer capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this application.

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder mask that is used. Older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound used to make them. These days boards are made of fibreglass for most general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). The light and dark green boards ofter seen have a ""dry film"" mask applied to them (usually applied as a complete film photographically produced). The blue (and red or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist formulation and are applied in a different manner.

I'm making a 7 stepper controller board,  with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.    One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is  bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip  numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244,  which will do you NO good for reading in.              Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:   First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.   In pascal, you would ""Write(Port[xxx]);"" where xxx is the address in  either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the  strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2,  so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output  to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal,  do ""Port[xxx]:=value "".                   Hope this helps.         Let me know if you need more help.       _________________________________________________   Inspiration  |   ___                             |   comes to     |  \   o  baden@sys6626.bison.mb.ca |   those who    | (  ^  ) baden@inqmind.bison.mb.ca |   seek the     |   /-\      =] Baden de Bari [=    |   unknown.     |                                   |   -------------------------------------------------   ","electronic"

Let's see if I can find the formulae somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind. <sounds of gears>  <fumes of overheated oil>  <unmistakable stench of the Nasal Chromatograph>   Ha!  I knew there was a double bond!  Now how shall I show that in ASCII?             MEK:                                 Acetone:            C - C - C - C                        C - C - C               #                                    #               O                                    O  The hydrogens are not shown, and # represents double bond.  MEK has a methyl (CH3) on one side, and an ethyl (C2H5) on the other.  Acetone has two methyls.  So acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone, but instead is dimethyl ketone.  Both solvents have similar properties.  I think that MEK may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe. It's a lot harder to buy MEK than it once was.  Use acetone.  Nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone.  If you buy some for your workshop, get the very cheapest, because the more expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you don't need. --  Nothing is so foolish that it has not been posted to some net newsgroup.          >>> Peter Neilson --- neilson@osf.org <<< Quote changed daily.

Well, Bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in Austria, there are no wall jacks yet, either - just wires sticking out of the wall (and put into a closed, often sealed, box) :-)   As far as I remember from Germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody had wires sticking, somebody had jacks...

One application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old Tektronix scopes.   These were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches. If you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic.   The silver was quite thin.   The 2% is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead.    Thus, no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution.   Other devices that use silver contacts are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers. -- -->>>>>>>>>> Peter Reilley ..... pvr@wiis.wang.com .....

The names of the companies (yes, companies!) are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes. According to them, it is not illegal (at least in the USA, according to a statute or  something) to remove the copy protection from any program. The only condition is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own convenience.  If there is any interest I will download the advertisement of one such  company.

Yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although I would handle it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  The chemical is called d-Limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (I think it is a lemon extract of some kind).  You might find it in a hardware store, sold as a general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store -- it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.

The reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder  The May 1993 cover of QST has a picture of three different boards without any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). The box labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one in the center has the grayish board exposed.  On the left is some  fiberglass board that looks green to me.  I see no reason for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).  I wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their low noise microwave preamps?  Often, microwave circuits have odd bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  A solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind  the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.

The curiosities that you speak of are EL (Electro-Luminescent) pads.  They are mostly used as backlights for LCD's, and as you pointed out, comes in several different colors.  Many of them emit white-ish colors (""true"" white, and blue-whiteis-blue are the ones that I've personally encountered the most often.)  They vary in their input requirements, however, they tend to operate at  about 100 Vrms, and at much higher than 60 Hz.  (400 Hz to 1 kHz, if I  recall correctly.)   You can get them to work at 120 Vrms, 60 Hz (i.e., line) but they don't glow as brightly, and they will degrade much faster.

The distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of critical.  I'm debating whether to mount it on it's side, which puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate, or mounting it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a small clearance.

I know for sure that the Everex Magic I/O EV-170A can be jumpered for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional I/O mode.

And later:      If an external device should be driving data on these pins (in     violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this     data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.  I will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind as a result of my saying, ``I DO NOT know for sure, but I think you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the data lines, while an external device drives them.''

You don't say what kind of ""electronic equipment"" you mean.  It's hard to give a generic answer.  There is essentially no solvent that won't do things like washing lubricant out of switches.  When we've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things, we've just used distilled water.  The key thing to remember is to make sure the gear is *completely* dry before powering it up again.  We let it dry for several days to be damn sure.  I doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water.

Call up Crown, the company that has the patent on the PZM, and ask them for information on construction and use of the things.  You may have to determine the correct spacing emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the Panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response, and you are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.  Crown has a nice book on the subject, though it's unfortunately rather short on mathematics.  There's a JAES article from many years back, too.  Still, for your application, you'll be a lot better off buying the cheap Radio Shack models and using Phil Rastoczny's modifications to get a clean balanced output.

Essentially what I am trying to decide is the best way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use by the smart data I/O.   Which DMA or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  Fast, cheap, and easy to obtain would be nice, but I won't limit my choices to only those that fit those characteristics.  Even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what I want, but I am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with onchip (E)EPROM.   So I essentially want to hear about all DMA and microcontrollers that are simple to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a few I/O lines.

One challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps! Knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor  technique of RESECTION to determine robot location. (No, I ain't going to explain resection over the net.)  Given hindsight, I would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling phototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at the several expected frequencies, to extract AMPLITUDE of each beacon. By doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledge of the angular response of the phototransistor, you SHOULD be able to rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.

Two things to watch for:    In Germany (and I think the same holds for Sweden) only some    of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the    phone can be set to pulse dialing.    In Sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits    are pushed ""down"" by one position; this makes dialing (and    in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.    Otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign    phone to either the German or Swedish phone system.    OTOH neither you nor I would ever try that, as it is of course    illegal.  As the phone uses DTMF dialing, which by some magic all telecom operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.  I don't think there are any switches in Sweden that can't handle DTMF dialing. Most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have been retrofitted with ""magic fingers"" that converts from DTMF to pulse dialing.

Well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a  resistor to a common output.  The resistors give some isolation so the signal sources aren't driving directly into each other.   Taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, I'd say that if you are mixing high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups, etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5K - 10K or so.  If you are mixing line-level stuff or the outputs of a Walkman, or such, I'd go with 1K.  input 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output                                | input 2 --/\/\/\/\-------------+                                | input 3 --/\/\/\/\-------------+   -- paul marxhausen .... ....... ............. ............ ............ ..........   .. . .  . . . university of nebraska - lincoln .  . . .. . .  .. . . . . . . .  .     .    .  .   .     .   .  .    .   .  .   .    .   .  grace .   .    .  .     .         .       .      .        .        .      .        .   happens .

I know locally, for most of the winter the ground, and concrete floor, within sheds and garages (unheated) is signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature.

The different settings on your modem are so that it uses CCITT V21 & V22  tones for data transmission, rather than Bell 103 & Bell 121 tones, which are  used only in the USA and canada AFAIK.

The intention is to prevent the test-lead-is-in-the-wrong-scocket beeper from going off when there is no test lead in that socket.  The manual is a bit vague, but I think I'd apply the WD-40 to a swab, then wipe the socket instead of spaying the stuff directly from the can.  Speaking of said meters:  I compared the 87 against the 8060A that I've had on my bench for almost 11 years.  It has been five years since the 8060A has been calibrated.  On the DC scale, they agree within .01 mV.  AC scale is within about .1 mV.  The 87 would be just about the perfect portable meter if it had the dB scale; I didn't feel it was worth the extra $100 for a second 8060 since I don't use dB all that much in my work.  --  Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services Department Rootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511 wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED","electronic"

Your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator, or just plain not having enough power.  I would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short peaks.  You can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator, or try strapping the amps for 240V service and running 240V mains cables out, which will minimize the line drop.  If these don't work, though, you're going to need a bigger generator.  I assume that you're using well-maintained generators, and have watched the voltage output on the generator properly.  If you don't have 120V coming out of the unloaded generator you'll never get 120V at the other end.  >Can anyone offer any advice?

I recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of work, and not with the pro-audio people.

Open up one of the airbag control boxes.  They have inexpensive piezoelectric accelerometers in them.  I know that the GM cars use the Setra units.

Perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries at the same ambient temperature.  I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have some validity.  Richard Dell ","electronic"
