If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for the same car.  So isn't that saving money?  Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:  1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.   2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.  Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even  the buyers for other cars will pay less.  Isn't that saving money?    $0.02, doug.","automotive"

In consumer reports it is ranked high in many catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars. Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).  A couple of things though: 1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this    car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's. 2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully    loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match    up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993    version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.  I guess my question is: Is this a good deal?  Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?  Thanks,  Carl Hoffman  P.S.

You can rev that car all day, everyday, and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak from expierence!) I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.  NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.

The earlier cars (pre  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having  chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are  appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the  moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles. If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car  should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere.   The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes  that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.

Concentrate more on ""where the rubber meets the road"" rather than driveability of cars in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform adequately in less than ideal conditions.  An aside:  I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough.

I thought it was worth looking into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems, ending with engine noises which she said ""was something with the heads"", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension with the Madza 626 and MX-6.

Jacking up the frame some more (had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden  platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to raise the frame ...

I used some string to tie the pack together while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.  Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too... until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.  One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a purse.  If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry lost millions.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general _decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical' curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature  5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.  Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer, to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.  Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature. As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).  In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or something.  Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature, thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature,  but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.    If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine (esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives, stick to the 10W40.   -- DON'T DRINK SOAP!

By the 1920s, there was a very active ""good roads"" movement, which had its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so, and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916 that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco ""America on the Road"" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called ""The Devil Wagon in God's Country"" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or John Bell Rae's auto histories.  As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I don't know why.

Actually, the SC300 (the   coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0   liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared   with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new   luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.

So isn't that saving money? 	 	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but  since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well worth it to buy the Saturn.  >Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000,  >then their cars will be even better deals.

Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't  make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per- car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.  >Isn't that saving money?  	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.

I may be wrong, but a loaded Tarus beats a Saturn SL2.  	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000 if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream Taurus sedan.

I'm sure that most SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds 0-60, if I'm not mistaken.

(in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.  Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to reveal the new right mode arrow.  The year after Iceland also changed.  About cars: Before the H-day (H as in ""Hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on the right side. :-)  More contries that uses the left side is:  Japan Tanzania (I think) New Zeeland How about South Africa?  BTW.

I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like ""Do you dare to risk your family in any car?"" attitude, which is quite annoying in the long run.  But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive, 2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine ""CAR"" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And the American magazine ""Road & Track"" said that ""This is not your uncle Olof's car"", and in a positive sense.  But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)  BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)  What? You mean what I drive?

There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).  Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time of speeding.  I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...  In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!  / Markus ","automotive"

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room. Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money. Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate.

In the early 80's with the fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their 350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer -- DON""T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.  Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving, LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them? Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines? No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a 500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.  I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine. Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that  when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350 engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about $2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again, you never need a tune-up.  If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal. Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.  Good luck.","automotive"

Go to KMart and buy the > cleaner yourself for $1.29.  This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector  cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)  Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a  discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron (not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however, a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the $59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to do it.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   Scott Keller	+1 314 537 6317	    The Agricultural Group of Monsanto Company    sekell@bb1t.monsanto.com  	KA0WCH		packet: ka0wch@k0pfx.mo.usa.na","automotive"

There has been a clutch  replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible,  as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable  shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll  cost you some $$.

The tint is rather weak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.  The inspection garage said that they won't pass it unless I get a waiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a waiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to show me the section of the vehicle code that says it's illegal.  He showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can't have tint, if you can't see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told him that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book and said ""It's just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you a ticket for it right now."" Well, won't argue with that...  Since the vehicle code says it's OK as long as you can see through the tint, I'd like to keep it (I'll re-read the vehicle code in the library).  I'd also like to get some sort of paper from the police that says it's OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won't get in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn't mind registering a complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.  So does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from the police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience registering a complaint against an officer? I called the station  later on today, but they basically said there is no place where I could register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide to keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do I stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?  Any comments about it will be welcome!  Michal ","automotive"

I knew about this previously, but this past weekend on PBS's MotorWeek Pat Goss  (their resident tech type) discussed these products, and recommends not using them (i.e, the non-isopropyl alcohlo based injector cleaners).  Supposedly only the isopropyl based cleaners actually remove moisture from your fuel tank as they clean your injectors.  And although the  others (ethyl based) do clean injectors they also cause rubber  components in the fuel system to deteriorate, and they don't mix well with water to help remove it from the fuel system.  I use a product recommended by VW called 44K (by BG Products, Inc.). It cost more about $14.00, but it is supposed to do the job without the potential harmful side effects, and its results are supposed to  last from 2k to 4k miles. I have also used Chevron's Techtrolene (sp?).  I can't say that i have noticed any difference using either, since i  only use these product as a preventative maintenance item.  >  >Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so. >Be suspicious. >  >jim grey >jwg@acd4.acd.com                                                    .                                                    /                 Larry                            __/    _______/_                  keys@csmes.ncsl.nist.gov       /                  \                                          _____     __     _____    \------- ===             ----------- / ____/   /  /   /__  __/              \          /     ___    /  / ___   /  /      / /    ____          |         |    /      \/ /__ /  | /  /__  __/ /__ /       \      /          /___         \_______/ /_____/ /______/            ====OO             \       /                           \       /                          -            1990 2.0 16v           -          ---------------- FAHRVERGNUGEN FOREVER! --------------------                         The fact that I need to explain it to you indicates             that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!        ------------------------------------------------------------","automotive"

Women's pants rarely have pockets and most, when they do, are too shallow to use!  I is very important for a woman to have her keys in her hand when she goes from building to a car. It is protect herself from would be assilants by broadcasting that this is someone who as a definite place of safty (ie a locked car!).  Puting keys and walet looks ugly! It breaks the lines and makes you rear look wide as a cows!   Also, to have the habits that work for any clothing situation, the pruse functions no mater what you are wearing! (even nude or a bikni)  A women's suit coat is lucky to have 2 pockets (2 on the outside, none on the inside). I have men's coats that have as much as 6 pockets! This is definitally not fair!!!  As one that wears both men's and women's clothes, I can tell you, women's clothes have few if any funtional pockets!  When dressed as a man, I put my wallet on my inside coat pocket and my keys in a coat outside pocket. It is much more covenent than the pants pockets and looks better.  Having a car that unlocks quickly and locks back fast is paramout to a woman's safty. Men don't see this as a problem. A woman is aware of this every time she goes out! (i.e. Image some red necks yelling at you ""We are going to FUCK YOU!"" and the out weight you by 20 lbs and have 3 inches in hight on you!)

Ok, here's what I understand:  The SL/SL1/SL2/SW1/SW2 was meant to compete with the following cars:  Honda Civic Toyota Tercel (SL,SL1) Toyota Corolla (SL1,SL2) Nissan Sentra Mazda 323/Protoge' Subaru Loyale/Impreza Isuzu Stylus Geo Prizm Ford Escort Mercury Tracer Mistubishi Mirage Plymouth/Dodge Colt   Their core competition is the Civic, Corolla, and Sentra.  Most of the other models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of. I threw in the Escort/Tracer because it has a good amount of Japanese technology and has similar reliability stats.  I didn't include domestic small cars such as the Cavalier, Sunbird, Shadow, Sundance, Tempo, and Topaz, since I think Saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of Japanese roots.  The SC1/SC2 was meant to compete against the following cars:  Toyota Paseo Honda Civic Si/Civic Coupes/del Sol Si Nissan NX1600/NX2000 Mazda MX-3 Isuzu Impulse Geo Storm Ford Escort GT   If you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're 4-door counterparts.  The is good reason for this.  It is a more upscale and trend-driven market.  Even though many of these models are based on sedan platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher prices.  Here are some of the platform derivations I can think of:  Tercel -> Paseo Sentra -> NX1600/NX2000 Civic -> del Sol 323 -> MX-3 (not sure on this one) Stylus -> Impulse/Storm  To illustrate, a Tercel starts at around $8000, while the Paseo starts at around $11,000.  Even a 4-door Tercel will cost less than a 2-door Paseo.  Now, you might be saying that the Tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors offer.  What I mean is that there is no 4-dr Tercel with a comparable powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  Let's take another example: the Isuzu Stylus XS and Impulse XS/Storm GSi.  Both have the same powerplants (a 1.6L 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive. Again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  People are willing to pay more money for this type of car.     In short, even though the SC1/SC2 may be smaller, hence ""less"" car, it's market orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent sedan (SL1/SL2) version.  I hope this clears things up a bit......   Mihir Shah 	 ","automotive"

Certainly there are tools for the job that are cheaper than an alignment rack, that do the job as competently (albeit, not as swiftly), if not more accurate, due to the natural pride an owner/mechanic places on his work. You can do an `acceptable' job of aligning a car using simple tools and some imaginative work that would *never* have the effect of endangering anyones life. The worst that happens is that your tires wear oddly (well, you could have the wheels aiming TOTALLY pigeon toed and not be able to steer the car, raise your hands those that think their vision is so poor that they would screw up this badly!)

Measure toe in, adjust to manufacturer specs. Camber a bit more difficult to adjust and measure ... I used a micrometer to measure the space between the rim and a funky bent up pipe that could be placed on upper and lower portions of the rim on the inside of wheel (hard to explain). This same tool could be used instead of the 2x4s.  I had made these tools up *right* after the last alignment done professionally so I had a reference that the original poster might not ...

The design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat ofuscated pattern into an EEPROM.  The idea was to make the circuit difficult to program arbitrary values into the EEPROM.  The secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the EEPROM being used. The microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the Hall effect at a rate any higher than 110 MPH so as to make spoofing the reading by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  This was for an automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 MPH in operation.  The case, of course, might not be the same for your 1993 RX-7!  The ECM modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions under which cars have been operated.  Since steering angle and velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the drivers' use of the car.  I am not aware of any manufacturer currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading out use data from the ECM.  While it could be a potential invasion of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your driving style, it could also provide valuable information from actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls  The Background: I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five  screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.  My question: What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than trying to drive with a hosed ankle.  I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying to give information as completly as I can).  I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system  instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?  It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the  negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?  It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned  the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.  The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get it?  I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:  	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a 	    device? 	2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC? 	3.  Are ""professionally"" installed CCs signifacantly better and 	    worth the cabbage? 	4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just 	    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple  	    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically, 	    the questions above)?  My father and I built a ""Veep"" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more complicated than my Veep. :-)  I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often (but I check my mail all the time).  Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.

I had picked out the vehicle I wanted and after a little haggling we   agreed on a price. I wrote them a check for the down payment plus tax and license and told them I'd be back that evening to pick up the truck.   When I returned, I had to wait about an hour before the finance guy could   get to me. When I finally got in there, everything went smoothly until he   started adding up the numbers. He then discovered that they had   miscalculated the tax & license by about $150. He then said he needed   another $150 from me. I said we had already agreed on a price and it was   their problem, I wasn't giving them any more money. The finance guy then   brought in the manager on duty who proceeded to give me a hard time. I   reminded him that I was the customer and I didn't think I should be   treated like that and that if he didn't back off he could forget the whole   deal. He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,   snatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by   the turn of events.  Early the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting   to know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and   asked if there was anything they could do to change my mind. I told him   that if they gave me the truck for free I probably still wouldn't take it,   that there were other dealers in town, I was a repeat customer of theirs   and that they should learn how to treat customers,etc,etc...I was still   pretty steamed about the whole affair. He gave me the line about hating to   lose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told   him not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.  A couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all   apologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus   knock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about   it and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,   and assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....  I thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we   decided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him   back and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the   truck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the   incident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of   there in my new truck in about 30 mins.  So, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not   have happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales   person talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I   sure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their   mistake.  Anyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred   dollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.   I'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.  Mark","automotive"

Most cars have drain petcocks in the radiators, and I've never  seen nor heard of a vandal opening one.  I imagine that there would be an even lower risk with an oil plug because you have  to crawl furthur under the car to open it.

The keywords `Monthly Posting' will always appear to make killing this article easy for users of newsreaders with kill facilities.  This article is posted to all autos groups, but followups are directed only to rec.autos.  If you don't understand what this means, ask your system administrator for help, or at least for copies of the newuser documentation.  Failing that, please subscribe to the newsgroup news.announce.newusers and read the documentation provided there.  Introduction to the Rec.Autos newsgroup hierarchy:  rec.autos.tech  is intended for technical discussions of automobiles, their design, construction, diagnosis, and service.  Other discussions are largely inappropriate, especially For Sale ads.  rec.autos.sport  is intended for discussion of legal, organized competition involving automobiles.  Technical discussions are appropriate insofar as they apply to competition vehicles.  Discussion from either of two viewpoints, spectator and participant, is encouraged.  Arguments about sports cars are largely inappropriate, as are most other discussions.  For Sale ads are inappropriate unless they are for competition vehicles and/or equipment. Discussions of illegal events are marginal; one should probably avoid advocating breaking the law.  (remember, the FBI reads Usenet!)  rec.autos.driving  is intended for discussions related to the driving of automobiles. Also, if you must discuss 55 vs. 65, or radar detectors, or <insert your pet driving peeve> boneheads, do it here.  rec.autos.vw  is intended for discussion of issues related to the use and ownership of automobiles manufactured by Volkswagen (this includes VWs, Audis, Seats, etc.)  It was created on the grounds that the info-vw mailing list was very successful.  It should not be presumed from the existence of this group that it is appropriate to create many groups to cover many different marques; groups specific to individual marques should only be created on demonstration of sufficient interest, via some avenue such as a mailing list.  rec.audio.car  is not properly part of the rec.autos.* hierarchy.  it is, however, the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment, and so is mentioned here.  rec.autos.antique  is intended for the discussion of older cars (usually more than 25 years old, although this is not a hard-and-fast rule.)  alt.hotrod  is not part of the hierarchy, but also of potential interest to the rec.autos reader.  it is gatewayed to the moderated hotrod mailing list, and is for serious discussion of modifying and developing performance vehicles.  alt.autos.rod-n-custom  also not part of the `official' hierarchy; devoted to that peculiar American hobby of customizing older cars.  alt.autos.karting  for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby, karting.  rec.autos  is intended to capture discussion on all other automotive topics.   Crossposting:  Crossposting occurs when more than one newsgroup name is included on the Newsgroups: line in the article header; such articles will appear in all of the newsgroups listed.  Crossposting is one of the most misunderstood and misused facilities on Usenet.  You should only post to a group because you feel an article is appropriate; you should NEVER crosspost just to reach a particular audience.  This distinction is subtle, but important.  Radar Detector articles, for example, are more-or-less appropriate in rec.autos.  They are almost never appropriate in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio, and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci.electronics or rec.ham-radio is NOT adequate justification for posting to either group.  Crossposting between any or all of the rec.autos.* groups is usually inappropriate; if you find yourself doing so, consider whether or not it is truly advisable, before sending your article.  Consider setting Followup-To: to point to only one newsgroup if you feel you must crosspost.  Crossposting between rec.autos.* and misc.consumers is chancy at best; in particular flame wars over the speed limit in the US and/or the use of radar detectors should NEVER be crossposted between any of these groups.  Most readers of sci.electronics and rec.radio.* couldn't care less about the police radar and radar detector arguments that go on endlessly in rec.autos.  It is an excellent idea to check the Newsgroups: and Followup-to:  lines of articles before posting a followup.  In particular, be wary of posting to misc.test, rec.arts.startrek.*, or talk.bizarre, or any combination of these three.  The life you save may be your own.  Distribution:  There is a field in the header of any news article which allows you to (partially) control where the article goes; it is called the Distribution field.  It may be very useful for many reasons; it should also serve as a reminder that news is a very large and widespread system.  The distribution of rec.autos.* is fairly extensive.  As of this writing,  the Automotive newsgroups are known to reach most of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and some locations in Japan.  With this in mind, I offer the following hints about use of the Distribution: field in your article headers, and on article content.  1) Please take care not to send for-sale ads about clapped out Ford Mavericks in New Jersey to France or California; i doubt that anyone in either place will care, except for my girlfriend, who for some strange reason likes Mavericks (but only 4-door Mavericks, at that.)  2) When posting technical questions, please include the market for which your car was manufactured.  For example, there are a number of differences between a European-market Ford Escort and a US-market Escort.  Likewise, all 1750cc and early 2000cc Alfa Romeos reached the US with Spica Fuel injection; European market cars usually got carbs (often Webers).  These differences can be important to your readers; make your situation clear. Failure to do so can lead to pointless flame wars and a significant spread of misinformation.  3) Be careful about your capacities and specifications when posting; in the US we get a mix of Metric and English system values, whereas Europe is almost entirely on the Metric system.  A future edition of this monthly posting will contain a list of commonly-used abbreviations that may not be known in some places that rec.autos reaches; this cuts both ways so let us not be parochial about it.  4) Use the Distribution: field to limit where your article goes, when possible.  Within North America, the values na (north america), can (canada), and usa may be used.  in addition, the two-letter state abbreviations of the US are supported in some cases; e.g. if i wanted to send an article only to New York and New Jersey, i could put ""ny,nj"" in a Distribution field.  note that multiple, comma-separated values are legal.  these distribution fields vary widely, however, so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what is likely to be supported in your area.  The Dangers of Overgeneralization:  To amplify a warning from the distribution section of this article: Be wary of making foolish assumptions about all cars, tires, etc.  What is true for a 1973 Buick with a 455cid engine may be quite utterly wrong for a 1976 Honda with a 1200cc engine.  Headlight laws in Sweden are decidedly different from those in Idaho.  The Need for Adequate Specification:  When you ask a question, please give a reasonable amount of information; e.g., if you have a question about your Honda, please specify year, model, engine size, etc.  Otherwise, most answers to your question may be quite useless.   Concerning Lemons:  At one time or another, every auto manufacturer has manufactured a lemon or two; even Honda admits to this.  Please don't waste everyone's time by announcing to the world that your `brand x' automobile is terrible, so all `brand x' automobiles are terrible, so no one should ever buy a car from the `brand x' company.  Such articles are worse than useless, because they cause substantial wasted bandwidth while carrying little or no useful information.   Concerning Flames:  As much as we might wish it, a flame-free newsgroup is something that most likely will never occur.  Here are some guidelines for flames and how to deal with them (a list of flame-prone topics follows in the next section of this posting):  If you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory, don't imagine for a minute that including the words `No Flames' will work.  It won't, and you'll get exactly what you deserve.  If you're going to flame, you're more likely to get away with it if you can cite a fact or maybe a well-known reference.  No one is likely to believe bald, unsupported assertions.  Be careful about who you choose to insult.  Consider not insulting anyone.   Asking the Question:  It is a bad idea to post a question and end it with a phrase like `Please send email, I don't read this group'.  It is a much better idea to end the question with `Please send email, if there is sufficient interest I'll summarize the results in a later posting.  I may miss posted responses to this request'.  Answering the Question:  If someone wants to hop up their Yugo, don't tell them to get a Mustang. Either be silent, or give them useful advice.  If someone wants advice on defending a speeding ticket, don't tell them to obey the law next time -- it's offensive, presumes guilt which is not proven, and doesn't directly address the original question.  In general, don't post in order to see your words in print, and don't post in order to enjoy feeling smug and self-righteous.   Stale and/or Inflammatory Topics:  Certain topics are considered stale by `old timers'; while discussion of them is certainly ok, and new, factual information is welcome, ravings about them are extremely tiresome, and may get the person who posts them ignored altogether.  Some topics are naturally inflammatory; it is difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of them.  Some of these topics include the following:  1)  the 55mph speed limit in the US: Pro and Con  2)  discussions about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of     radar detectors.  3)  discussions over which radar detector is best.  4)  discussions over what is a sports car (this is one reason why     rec.autos.sport is not a `sports car' group -- everyone would argue     about what constitutes a `sports car'.)  5)  disputes over whether or not US Federal law protects the driver's     right to own and operate a radar detector  6)  `Buy American' discussions  7)  `clever' bumper stickers and personalized license plates  8)  <insert nationality here> cars are terrible  9)  What kind of car did Maxwell Smart drive?

A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the     overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually     narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the     sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire     has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel     diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'     tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like     390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed     rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly     inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common     speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to     150MPH.)      Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed     rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find     designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load     associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous     operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is     a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum     per-tire loads:      Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157     Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125      Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.      In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire     size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation     indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application     of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters     only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of     interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For     the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference     between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at     all.      If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.      Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating     reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)      There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,     traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded     A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is     a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they     are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are     thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.  Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put     normal tires on the car?  A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.     Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible     with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them     so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that     more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)     You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your     car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly     dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,     or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard     to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear     has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.  Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side     of my car?  A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many     say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a     car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others     (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping     is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before     rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the     car should I put them on?  A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't     get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow     conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there     are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear     wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car     going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car     (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,     stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the     snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes     while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.  Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:  Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits     in this Q&A posting?  A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between     misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless     flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please     subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.  Safety Equipment:  Q:  Do airbags really work?  A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much     better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than     Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than     3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend     to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the     explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but     not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention     of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.  Brake Questions:  Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas     always wants to do this.  A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing     rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors     more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped     warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or     to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas     are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical     to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,     or badly grooved.  Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is     this really a good idea?  A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade     prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of     downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases     of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more     than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they     are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.      On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA     still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I     suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to     do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a     car with an automatic to take the test.  Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?  A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to     absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake     system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type     are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The     principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry     boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling     point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest     wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better     boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling     point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see     the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that     DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific     cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly     competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_     improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for     DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out     fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid     out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.  Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?  A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks     excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone     based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and     DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound     like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in     such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any     metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend     to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where     most of the corrosion occurs.      Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to     Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly     beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the     brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.      Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are     difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which     interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they     generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they     do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable     in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense     in some street car applications, but they are certainly not     recommended for high performance driving applications, and the     economics are questionable for street use.      I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard     that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably     compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little     information at this time.  Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs     more.  Is it worth it?  A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will     be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer     is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally     work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does     not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),     and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques     like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.      Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the     car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able     be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several     systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is     what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence     of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed     sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and     may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original     equipment or OE-equivalent components.      When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking     the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the     system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS     will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a     sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could     sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is     achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as     the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are     truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system     this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this     duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;     on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform     threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on     snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes     locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,     has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this     eventuality.      A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves     steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are     braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release     the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off     on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.     Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.      An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical     braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on     glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.     The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an     ABS system in your car.      As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential     restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the     following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder     for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master     cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for     over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5     (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of     the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system     components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid     becomes very important.  Q:  What about this threshold braking business?  A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent     publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers     in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is     needed here -- rpw]      Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high     performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab     the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much     to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate     maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but     just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold     brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn     to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake     pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the     threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.     In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're     not very near the threshold.      In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just     before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on     the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very     close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better     stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS     take over.      Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of     accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with     ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed     the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now     seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the     involved officers had any recent performance driving training.     There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing     brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique     of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to     try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you     think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must     cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least     1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that     much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.     Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective     and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if     you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at     the pedal will be sufficient.      Gas Questions:  Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?  A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the     engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.     On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your     car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car     needs.  Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?  A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,     although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase     in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded     gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,     check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not     actually require leaded gasoline.  Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?  A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use     dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.     Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl     Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs     and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.      Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes     called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's     manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider     10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol     (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected     cars.      An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with     fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that     do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain     Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything     in your gas tank.      There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are     noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work     much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,     Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,     once every six months, is highly recommended.  Q:  What about detergent gasolines?  A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW     has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this     test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test     are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such     gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.     Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean     engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.  Lubrication Questions:  Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?  A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter     code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	     uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are     for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine     applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels     of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,     SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.      The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either     a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by     the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly     used these days, and are the only type that most automobile     manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the     designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;     the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity     of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually     get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What     is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity     of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast     as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the     viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.      Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not     all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all     30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the     novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has     been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils     do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,     15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.  Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?  A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out     there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure     that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on     your wallet at all times.  Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?  A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have     come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based     additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the     chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,     auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET     responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight     increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term     results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are     debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the     product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes     deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners     have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of     Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50     Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as     it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are     no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.      On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.  Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?  A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,     but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by     oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to     change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your     car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change     the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty     as conventional oils.      Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter     entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very     effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.  Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.     How often should I change my oil?  A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)     gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs     down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,     you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you     only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up     to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,     perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are     now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car     much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change     oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,     then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out     of storage.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they     break.  What's the story?  A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,     for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but     the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.     Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.      If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the     belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent     replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if     there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time     (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have     a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,     destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage     as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water     pump can be a costly mistake.)  Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it     self destructs when the timing belt breaks?  A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the     valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression     ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are     more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance     oriented vehicles.  Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?  A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety     Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be     caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the     same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report     goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator     is probably the cause. --  richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith","automotive"

MILITECH(tm) is yet another oil additive. But the demonstration of this product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.  The setup of the demo is fairly simple. A cone shaped rotor is half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. The rotor is powered by an electronic motor. A metal pad is pressed against the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction.  The torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.  Before MILITECH was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft of torque (You pick the brand of oil, no difference). Once MILITECH was  added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of torque.   Here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink,  you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.  They say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. A 16 oz bottle is $25.  I still have my doubts. If this product is really so great, why it was so little known? The salesman said it is widely used in military. I didn't believe it.  The demo was so impressive, that I bought a bottle against my common sense.  Has anyone heard of or actually used this product? Is it real? If you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the  second floor. See if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.  Jason Chen ","automotive"

A:  In the US, currently Virgina and the District of Columbia prohibit     all usage of radar detectors.  New York prohibits their use in     large trucks.  In Canada, they are illegal in Manitoba, Ontario,     Quebec, Newfoundland and PEI (Prince Edward Island).  They     are apparently are illegal through most, if not all, of Europe.     Legislation which would make them illegal is pending in many other     jurisdictions; chances of such legislation passing varies a great deal.  Q:  Where are Radar Detector Detectors used?  Do they really work?  A:  Usage is spreading rapidly; initially they were used only in Canada,     but now they are appearing in New York and Virginia.  It is unsafe     to assume that they are not in use in Connecticut and D.C.     They work by detecting a certain frequency radiated by many currently     available super Het radar detectors; some brands of detector radiate     more strongly than others, and are thus more likely to be spotted.     New radar detectors are becoming available which may not be detected     by the current generation of detector detectors.  Note that a     detector may only be spotted by one of these devices if it is turned     on.  Q:  What is VASCAR?  Is it some kind of Radar?  A:  VASCAR is nothing more than a fancy stopwatch and time-speed-distance     computer.  It depends on the operator pressing buttons as the target     vehicle passes landmarks.  No radar signals are emitted by a VASCAR     system.  Q:  What is Ka band radar?  Where is it used?  Should a radar detector be     able to handle it?   A:  Ka band has recently been made available by the FCC for use in the US     in so-called photo-radar installations.  In these installations, a     low-powered beam is aimed across the road at a 45 degree angle to the     direction of traffic, and a picture is taken of vehicles which the     radar unit determines to have been in violation of the speed limit.     Tickets are mailed to the owner of the vehicle.  Because of the low     power and the 45 degree angle, many people believe that a radar     detector cannot give reasonable warning of a Ka band radar unit,     although some manufacturers of radar detectors have added such     capability anyway.  The number of locales where photo-radar is in use     is limited, and some question the legality of such units.  Best advice:     learn what photo radar units look like, and keep track of where they     are used (or else, don't speed.)  Q:  Do radar jammers work?  Are they legal?  A:  Quick answer:  No, and Not in the USA.     Detailed answer:  Cheap radar jammers do not work well at all.     Jammers that work are expensive and usually the property of the     military.  Jammers are a major violation of the regulations of the     Federal Communications Commission of the USA.  Driving technique and Vehicle Dynamics Questions:  Q:  What are understeer and oversteer?  A:  Understeer and oversteer are terms describing the behaviour of a     car while cornering near the `limit' (limit of adhesion, that is.)     Most drivers do not normally drive hard enough for these terms to     be descriptive of the situations they encounter.  Simply put, they     tell whether the car wants to go straight in a corner (steer `less',     or `understeer') or it wants to turn more in a corner (`oversteer'.)     Understeer is commonly designed into most production cars so that     untrained drivers, inadvertantly traveling too fast, won't get into     trouble.  Understeer may also be induced by using too much throttle     in a corner.  Oversteer is designed into some more performance     oriented cars; it may be induced by lifting on the throttle (Trailing     throttle oversteer, or TTO).  In extreme cases, lifting on the throttle     may induce so much oversteer that the car reacts by fishtailing or     spinning.      Some technical details:  in a corner at speed, the tires on the car     will develop what are called `slip angles'; the slip angle is the     angular difference between the direction that the car is traveling     and the direction that the steering wheel is directing the car to     travel.  In understeer, the front wheels have a greater slip angle     than the rear wheels.  In oversteer, the rear wheels have a greater     slip angle than the front wheels.  Q: What is a rev-matched downshift?  A: When downshifting, the engine must be rotating faster in the lower gear    than it was in the higher gear.  However, during a downshift, normally    you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle, so the revs drop    rather than increase.  In rev-matched downshift, you blip the throttle    before re-engaging the clutch so that the engine will already be up to    the new speed.  This results in a much smoother and faster downshift.  Q: What does heel-and-toe mean?  A: Heel-and-toe is a technique used to do a rev-matched downshift while    braking.  This is normally challenging, because you need the right foot    for both the brake and throttle.  It is called heel-and-toe because you    use one end of the foot on the brake, and the other on the throttle to    match revs for the downshift.  In many modern cars this is a misnomer;    often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side    on the throttle.     Note that some race car drivers will skip the clutch, and just use the    left foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle, accomplishing    the same thing.  Q: What is double-clutch downshifting?  A: While your right foot is doing the above, your left foot can do one of    three things:  nothing, declutch once, or declutch twice.  The reason for    declutching twice is to match the speeds of the two shafts in the    transmission to the speed of the engine.  This is usually coupled with    rev-matching, so that while the engine is in neutral and the clutch    engaged, the throttle is blipped and both shafts of the transmission    speed up.     The procedure is as follows:    (0) declutch    (1) move gearshift lever to neutral    (2) engage clutch    (3) match revs    (4) declutch    (5) move gearshift lever to next lower gear    (6) engage clutch     This sounds like a lot of work, but with practice it becomes natural.    The problem that double-clutching solves is normally the function of the    synchronizers within the gearbox.  In transmissions without synchros or    with very worn synchros, double-clutching makes it much easier to shift.    Basically, if you double-clutch well, you are not using the synchros at    all.  This is generally unnecessary on street cars with synchros in good    condition.  Q: What do the numbers for acceleration from 0-60, 1/4 mile, skidpad, and    slalom times in the Auto Magazines really mean?  May they be compared?  A: In short, 1) not as much as the magazines want you to believe, and    2) almost never.     In more detail:  the acceleration numbers (0-60mph and 1/4 mile times    in the US) may be vaguely compared as long as they all come from the    same source.  Testing procedures vary so much from magazine to magazine    that comparing a Road & Track number to a Car & Driver number is quite    pointless.  Keep in mind, too, that the same variation applies from    driver to driver on the street; the driver is a major (often *the*    major) part of the equation.     Skidpads vary, and even if they didn't, skidpad figures are really    only tests of the stickiness of the stock tires; they change radically    when tire compounds change.  DO NOT make any assumptions about the    comparative handling of, say, two sports sedans based on skidpad numbers.    This is not to suggest that skidpads are without value, however. Skidpads    are an excellent educational tool at driving schools.  They are simply    of limited value in the comparison of anything except tires.     Slalom times are slightly more useful; they test some small parts of the    automobile's transient response.  However, they are also heavily influenced    by the stock rubber on the car, and they do not test many corners of the    car's envelope.  They DO NOT tell you all you need to know before making    a buying decision.  For example, they don't tell you what the rear end    of the car will do on a road which suddenly goes off-camber.  When a car    has an adjustable suspension, these tests are usually done in the `sport'    setting, which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving.  The list of    caveats could go on for page after page.  Q: My buddy claims that wide tires don't make any difference, according    to his freshman physics textbook, and that you can't ever accelerate    or corner at more than 1.0G.  Does he know what he's talking about?  A: 1) in short:  he hasn't got a clue.     2) in more detail: the equations for friction used in freshman physics    textbooks presume that the surfaces are smooth,  dry and non-deformable,    none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of a    stone cold tire on dry pavement which is far below its proper operating    temperature.     Pavement is _never_ smooth; it is always irregular to a greater or lesser    extent.  Tires, which are not really dry and solid (as rubber is a    substance which in its natural form is liquid, and which has only been    coerced into a semblance of solidity by chemical magic), deform to match    the surface of the pavement which a vehicle is traveling over.  In a tire    at operating temperature, grip is actually generated by shear stresses    inside the deformed rubber, and not by anything even remotely resembling    friction in the freshman physics sense of the term.  The colder a tire    is relative to its operating temperature, the closer its behaviour will    be to the traditional concept of friction; if much hotter than the its    proper operating temperature, the more likely the possibility of some    part of the tire actually ``reverting'' to liquid, which is mostly like    to happen deep in the tread, causing characteristic blisters and chunking.    (This latter, though, is almost completely unlikely to happen in normal    street driving, so unless you're a competition driver or do a lot of    high speed track driving, don't worry about it.)     Because tire traction is completely out of the domain of simple friction,    it does not obey the freshman physics equation at all; thus dragsters    accelerate at more than 1.0G and race cars corner and brake at more than    1.0G.  Because simple friction does not apply, it is actually possible    for different sized contact patches to generate differing amounts of    grip.  An actual analysis of tire behavior would require techniques    such as Finite Element Analysis, due to the complexity of the mechanism.  Misc. Questions:  Q:  What does <name or acronym> stand for?  A:  Here is a list of some of the names which are commonly asked     about; be careful in soliciting the meanings of other names     as misinformation abounds on the net.  In particular, NEVER     ask in rec.humor if you want a useful result.      Saab:   Svenska Aeroplan A. B.,               or The Swedish Airplane Corporation      Alfa:   Societa Anonima Lombarda Fabbrica Automobili,               or The Lombardy Automobile Manufacturing Company      Fiat:   Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino,               or The Italian Automobile Manufacturers of Turin      BMW:    Bayerische Motoren Werke,               or Bavarian Motor Works      MG:     Morris Garage   Q:  Does VW own Porsche?  A:  No.  Porsche is a publicly held company, controlled by the Porsche and     Piech families.  Porsche has extensive business dealings with VW/Audi,     which causes some confusion.  Since currently Porsche is in some     financial difficulty, there is a possibility that Mercedes or VW may     be interested in purchasing the company in the near future, but this     is only speculation at this time. --  richard welty        518-393-7228       welty@cabot.balltown.cma.com ``Nothing good has ever been reported about the full rotation of   a race car about either its pitch or roll axis''  -- Carroll Smith","automotive"

This article will provide the essential information for doing so on standard Unix systems.  A shell script and examples of alias file setups are included which presently run on a Sparc 2 here at balltown.cma.com for a number of mailing lists.  Note that if you do set up an automotive mailing list, please let me know of the -request address so that I can list it in the montly rec.autos posting.  Also inform the keeper of the Usenet list-of-lists (check news.answers for this monthly posting.)  First of all, to get anywhere, you need to either 1) be a sysadmin, or 2) have some measure of assistance from your sysadmin.  It is also important that you have reasonably good network connectivity; if it seems like you get everything several days after anyone else, or that you have trouble getting email through, then your network connectivity is probably not good enough.  Listserv:  There is a handy automated mailing list package named listserv, which is available from several ftp servers on the network.  Details of the installation and operation of listserv are beyond the scope of this article, but anyone who is considering running a large mailing list should probably  look at listserv carefully.  The Alias file:  On a typical unix system; there is a file named /usr/lib/aliases on whichever file server is your mail host; it contains lines such as:  foo:   bar, baz, bletch   which means that any email sent the name `foo' on that host is redistributed to users bar, baz, and bletch.  thus, the simplest possible email list is   my-favorite-car:  member1, member2, member3, my-address my-favorite-car-request: my-address  this has a couple of problems; the most noticeable one being that you have to be superuser to edit the alias file.  however, you can do the following, with the connivance of your sysadmin:  my-favorite-car: :include:/home/mydir/misc/autos/my-favorite-car-list my-favorite-car-request: my-address  Where the file specified is a list of comma and newline separated addresses.  This file can be in the list admin's home directory, owned by the list admin.  Bounced Mail:  this still has a problem; bounced mail usually gets distributed to all the members of the list, which is generally considered somewhat irritating. Therefore, the way that the driving school mailing list is set up is instructive (Thanks to harpal chohan of the bmw list for this setup, by the way.

Backup lights mounted on the side >would actually be *extremely* useful for people backing out of >parking stalls...  While I can't think of any Corvettes with side mounted backup lights, I know that Saab started using them about 15 years ago.  My 1975 Saab 99 didn't have them, but a friend's 1978 Saab 99 certainly did.  In addition to the confentional tail-light mounted backup lights, they had another set integrated into the front turn signal assembly.  For those of you who don't remember, Saabs of that vintage had an enormous multicoloured plastic growth, about the size of a _National Geographic_ magazine, sticking out of the front fender, which incorporated amber ""parking lights"", amber side marker lights/reflectors, white ""cornering lamps"" (like American luxury cars) aimed towards the side of the road when you have your turn indicators on, and white ""backup lights"" aimed towards the back of the car when you have selected reverse gear.  The glossy brochure showed how these front mounted backup lights were useful for illuminating hazards (pot holes, kid's toys, etc) that would be run over by the front of the car if you had the wheels turned while backing up.

I stated that I  would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer ""for their own good"" or for any reason other than I was prevented from  doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your  chances of being ""offed"" or involved in an accident, especially if  this ""passer"" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person riding your bumper is certainly NOT a ""wise driving practice"", it  only causes the jam to become more congested.    I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the  road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a ""pack""  of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you  decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal  with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their  pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to  pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and  do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I  feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the  actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers  on the road who do not intentionally impede others.    If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they  are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all  else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the  message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never  safe to ride anyone's bumper.

Yes, on the showroom floor, the cars have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs that aren't clear coated.  On the other hand, it seems that every clear coated car that I've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has fine scratches throughout the paint job.  As does, alas, my 1992 Laser.  Several weeks ago I had my car professionally polished and waxed. When I picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that I remember from a year ago when I bought it.  Several days ago I took my car to the dealership for some work.  As an added bonus, they washed my car.  Unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  Now my showroom shine is a haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light hits the roof at a particular angle.  I am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  Do I have any  chance of getting the dealership to do something about this? My guess is 'no'.  Is there any product on the market that provides a solution to this problem?  Or am I faced with the prospect of having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches? Information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .

They are asking for $1500.  Is that a fair deal?  The only thing I noticed about the NX2000 is that the engine did not seem to have as much torque as my Sentra which has the same identical engine.  I presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine to it's limits occassionaly while I did that on mine, thuis the NX2000's engine is a little ""tight.""

If they get caught, there is no punishment  at all.  In the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping  with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand  what kind of damage such accidents cause.   Of course this doesn't happen  any more.  That whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching  him some respect for others.  A person with that little respect would  inevitably wind up dead early anyway.     The problem is creeping gradualism.  If you put a frog into hot water,  he just jumps out.  But if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-  gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  This is what the entertainment  industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our  modern North American society have done to us over the years.  Now that  we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.  #> #>Erik velapold #  #Society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams!

They don't care because the #message they hear is ""Life is Cheap""!    And the education system and the Religious Leaders aren't doing much   about it, either.  With both parents working in this society, where is  the stabilizing influence at home?   Latchkey children are everywhere!  And these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to  whatever violent hate-promoting ""music"" and videos they like because no  one is home to stop it.    This day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn  than when I went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is  shorter school hours and more leisure time!  I say keep the kids in  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  There  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will  bring a parent to grief.  Daycare systems are not the answer.

You asked about insurance for performance cars.  Well, last year     I was in a similar situation before I bought my car, and made the     same inquiry as you.       Age: 24 (then and now)     Car: 1992 Eagle Talon TSi AWD     Driving Record: Clean     State: Illinois     Cost: $820/6 mos.       I turn 25 in May and the insurance goes down to $520/6 mos.     Also, I'm single and that incurs a higher rate with my company.       I've got a couple other friends w/ AWDs and they pay more     than I do (different ins. companies also), so maybe I'm just lucky.       Hope the info helps.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica GT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners included the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years). I narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling (and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less money and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury car.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924. I was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i decided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked about what would happen to my rate with either car.   ""If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as the Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because the car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue to handle your account.   ""If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard [higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with a 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year, but cancel you after that.""   ""But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually faster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.""    That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For some reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers - as very traditional and conservative.""   I eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure guy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken a year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft.      /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\| |\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.   / | |/ ||\|\  \_|\/|_|/|)[_|\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil ========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======           ======================================================================== 32   I live in Idaho.

Also, I have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal (no accidents, tickets, car gets older??) to maintain a low rate.

Are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't screw up the car.  Things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?

A little-known fact is that the Chevrolet Co. actually took over GM! That was how Durant got back in charge of GM-- legally his new company Chevrolet Co. did the buying, and GM was a division of Chevrolet!  After 1920 and into the Sloan era, GM shuffled things so that the GM board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given the Chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.

(i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the 	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and 	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's 	another curve approaching)  3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is 	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern 	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode. 	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about 	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as 	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.  also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a 5 speed)?    how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear, low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.   eliot","automotive"

It's a normal manual transmission gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do the shifting.   That means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if You take out  minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions  (Ferrari, Williams, McLaren(?),...) don't tell You, when to shift, either. However, these transmissions share an important disadvantage with Your stock auto-trannie: They are EXPENSIVE.  As long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on  'normal' cars I'm gonna stick with my manual. I just can't see an advantage to make up for two grand I lose in this deal and the loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). But then I drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.

I was raised by a pack of wild corn dogs.       We here are *VERY* interested in info on R12 substitutes (in fact I  think we really need all the info on this we can get).      I would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade  details.       Also, R12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of  certain pharmaceuticals.  Any info on the substitutes' corresponding  usefullness?      I am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure  we are compliant with the regulations.  The trouble with regulations is  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what  you should do instead.       I think the cause of the new regulations is the Montreal Protocol  which has a definite CFC-phase-out schedule.  (Of course the cause of  the Montreal Protocol was all the research done on the causes of the  Ozone Depletion Problem.)       Someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast  to ban the ozone-depleting (CFC) chemicals and not gasolines and other  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  The greenhouse effect (produced by  infrared-trapping gasses like CO2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same  thing.  It is a lot easier to do something about not using the CFC's  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing CO2 and methane which  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.  Planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.   Fred W.

My whole point was not to say that the cars *couldn't* go that fast, but that they *shouldn't* go that fast.  A family sedan designed to be operable at 85mph doesn't suddenly become operable at 130mph because you added some plastic aero effects, slightly wider tires, and a much larger engine.  That's what the SHO is -- a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine.  They didn't even bother improving the *brakes.*  The Mustang is essentially the same deal as the SHO -- a big power plant stuck in a mid-size sedan, with almost no other modifications. I have real-life experience with the Mustang -- it handles like a brick (except when you're invoking oversteer, of course, something I personally avoid doing on the highway) and stopping power is inadequate even from 80mph.  Lots of accelleration -- but the rest of the car is not up to par.  I picked the Porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind.  It didn't have to be the 911 -- it could have been the much cheaper 944 or one of several Mercedes or Audi models.  All of these cars are fairly expensive -- but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed.  This should be elementary.  There are a few things to keep in mind about Europe, since you brought it up.  My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe the following to be true:  1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here. 2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than    they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them    far more predictable than most US highways. 3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have    speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in    the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not    much higher than 120km/h.  I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph (nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong.  Some people have no respect for their own lives.  >>You certainly haven't convinced me.  >	Of course not.  ""Speeding-is-bad.  Speeding-is-illegal.  >I-will-not-speed.  I-love-Big-Brother.""

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't 'pass it on' (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or more lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C. area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos won't make room.  We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start- stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be real useful here.  Bob  PS: If you drive the beltway and want to merge, look for a brown Probe with a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I don't read minds, but I do try to be courteous.

Perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all testified that the BATF shot first, they they did not identify themselves before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and the announcement from the BATF that they have sealed the warrant under which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way, _not_ an arrest warrant.

In my mind the Mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90 or so. It just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, Mustangs outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in junkyards.

When a friend of mine went shopping for a small sedan a few years ago, she brought me along as a token male so the salespeople wouldn't give her the ""bimbo"" treatment. Her first choice was a Mazda 323, and second choice was a Nissan Sentra.  We went to a Mazda dealership and described what ""we"" wanted.  We started negotiating on the price, and the salesdroid kept playing the ""let me run this price by the sales manager"".  After playing the ""good salesman, bad salesman"" game, we finally told him that if he didn't have the authority to negotiate a price, perhaps we should be speaking directly to someone who did.  He brought in the sales manager who proceeded to dick us around with every trick in the book.  (Read Remar Sutton's ""Don't Get Taken Every Time"" for a list.)  Finally, after playing a few more rounds of ""you'll have to work with us on this price"", also known as ""each time you come up a thousand dollars we'll come down ten"", the salesmanager gave a signal to his two sales cronies, stood up, and said ""well, we can't come down any more so I guess we can't help you"" and they trouped out of the room, leaving us sitting in the salesman's office all by ourselves.  Hmm. I'd read that sleazy salesmen sometimes bug their own offices so they can leave and listen in on couples discussing the sales offer, and I mentioned this aloud to my friend while we were sitting there wondering why they would leave us in the office instead of showing us to the door.  For lack of anything better to do, I picked up the phone on the desk and called another Mazda dealership, asked for a salesman, and began discussing what kind of price they would consider.  A few sentences into the conversation, Mr. Salesmanager broke into the line (!) and began telling me how rude he thought it was that I would call another dealership from ""his"" phone!  I said that since he'd announced that our business was over, he shouldn't care, and every time I tried to talk to the other sales guy the sales manager would drown out our voices with his own.  (How did he know that I was using the phone, anyway?)  Finally, I hung up and we headed out of the showroom. Sales manager and cronies come out of a little unmarked room and he begins to berate us again.  We say that we won't bother him anymore, we're going next door to the Nissan dealership.  Then comes the part I wish I could have videotaped.  As we go out the front door, the sales manager SHOUTS across the entire showroom, customers and all, ""Go ahead!  You DESERVE to buy a Nissan!"" So my friend bought a Sentra.  Just so the guilty won't go unpunished, I'll mention that the sales manager's name was Gary Tusone.  From his manner, his refusal to come down to a reasonable price, and his anger at the end, my guess is that he had bet our original salesman (who was a young novice) that he'd be able to get at least X dollars out of us, and he was steamed that we wouldn't fall for his slimy tricks.","automotive"

I am looking to buy this 1990 Nissan Maxima GXE for CDN$14000 right now. The car has 96000 km (or about 60000 miles) on it. A typical mileage for 1990 cars seem to be about 70000 km (or about 43K mi). The seller just informed me that when he brought the car in for certification he was told that the front break pads and the exhausts had to be replaced to meet the legal standards.  (He said he will replace the components before selling the car to me.)  Being copmletely ignorant to the technical stuff on cars, I don't know what this could mean... Is 96K km about the time typical for replacing the above mentioned items? Or is this an indication that the car was abused? Would other things break down or have to be replaced soon? The seller told me that he used the car on the highway a lot, but, I don't know how to verify this...  I've seen the paint chipped away in tiny dots in the front edge of the hood, though.  Although the Maxima is an excellent car and the car is very clean and well kept, it's currently out of warranty (a similarly priced '90 Accord with 70K km will have 2 years or 30K km worth of warranty left) and I don't want to worry about paying for any repair bills... But, I also need a car for 5 people...    When will the new Maxima come out, by the way?  I would very much appreciate your input in this.

Backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used to be on older cars. Those on my Taurus Wagon are quite bright enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're  MUCH brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s.   Insofar as Vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the car's hindquarters.  Those aren't just white reflectors.   Harv","automotive"

I'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple strut suspension (that is, with no upper A-arm)?  Just a strut going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an A-arm), with a tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?  	Anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening the strut below the perch.  In each of these cases, the suspension geometry will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the intended angle.  A spacer placed between control arm and the bottom of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore the suspension geometry.  IMHO, the kit that includes the spacer is the only way to go...  --Ken --  Ken R.

My Autobahn knowledge is admittedly second-hand, but I believe >the following to be true:  My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can correct your statements about our Autobahn:  >1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.  Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg- ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic). What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due to fear':  When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :). So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex- posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to handle it - or you lose...  That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation -  whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened) and each accident is one accident too much.  >2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than >   they are here, and usually include animal fences.  This makes them >   far more predictable than most US highways.  Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto- bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word -  a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high); those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.  >3. Not all of Europe is the Autobahn.  Most places in Europe have >   speed limits that aren't out-of-line with what we used to have in >   the US -- if my friends weren't lying to me they're typically not >   much higher than 120km/h.  You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) - but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...  >I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph >(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...  Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.  >                                                      ...  Some people >have no respect for their own lives.  I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at 130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph, it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on a bicycle: Your're dead.

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented  about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old  '93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since  the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a  service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you  may be able to get your dealer to fix it.  >Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?) >air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) >condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.

C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!  Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the ""credit card"" key that  came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))  >Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.

It's pretty much takes up all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.  Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind. The previous Probes had Japanese horns.  >Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.  >My Likes: >engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 >handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) >transmission (the 5 speed is a must) >usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) >Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) >stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) >low cowl (good visibility in front) >Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) >ABS/Air bag (see above) >rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) >No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) >Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-) I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!  >I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.  I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like this concerning the '93 Probes.  I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering that I was expecting the worst from them!  From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with  the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but  I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

Two Jensen Interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?  Porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)  THREE Ferarries, a Mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model that I couldn't identify.  And at the bottom, a late 70s MG convertable.  Outside there was a rotting Rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly sold in the U.S.  And in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an Alpha Romeo or a Lancia. It was about the size of an Austin Mini. The trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator  in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk and go to the outside from here. The taillights looked like they would be the round type (if they were there). Does anyone know what the make of this one is?    Certainly made my day...  --  Graham E.

At the same  It seems sad that people lose all perspective when they here about a case of violence by teenagers...  For a little perspective:  How about the thousands of kind teenagers who volunteer at local agencies to help children, seniors, the homeless?  Did you read about all the kids at Stanford who spent their spring breaks helping out in inner city areas? What about the hundreds of volunteers ( teenagers and others) who worked to clean up the mess after the Rodney King riots in LA?  Have you gone to your local high school play recently? Attended the school orchestra performances? Have you seen how many kids volunteer to pick up trash, plant trees, do walk-a-thons? How many kids have tried to sell you stuff to benefit organizations they belong to? How many girl scout cookies have you bought? How many chocolate bars for good causes?  The media picks up on all the anomalies, the sensational...  What about the wonderful teenagers all over the place who work hard at school, get good grades, go to college (or to work) and make a real contribution to our society?  All humans are teenagers at some time in their lives! Mother Theresa was a teenager and so was Geoffrey Dahmer.  It is really sad to see so many people who buy the sensational reporting of the media as some kind of reflection of the world today!

That is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live.  If you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to get one simply as a deterrent.  However, if a professional thief wants your vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  But to slow down any thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  That would be:  1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off 2)	a flashing red LED  These two are basic to a decent alarm system.   To slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock. That should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target. But, then there's always car-jacking.   Why is life so confusing? I hope I helped somewhat.  ************************************************************************ Jason Yow				Human Factors Psychology Program Wright State University, Dayton, OH	E-mail: jyow@desire.wright.edu ************************************************************************","automotive"

This morning, my 88 Ford Ranger was idling at 10,000 RPM. Ok, so I exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  It has a 2 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would cause the idle to drop back to normal (I don't think the linkage is stuck). What can I do to fix this problem?  This has been a problem from time to time, but has straightened itself out - until now.  I don't have a tach, but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast as it should be.  This is down from what it was idling at when I pulled up at a stop light.

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..  I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles) after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude,  and Celica.  Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.    My criteria: a ""fun"" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K. I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out. The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag. Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS). The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy. The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.   I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me. The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went. The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat overpriced too) in non-turbo form. I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind. I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more. Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)  The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:  My dislikes: Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal. Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?) air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch) condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely. crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical) parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical). assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not  stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke. Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies! Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when I bash my head on the corner. horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference) Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car   My Likes: engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1 handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits) transmission (the 5 speed is a must) usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere) Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive) stability at 100+mph (high gearing though) low cowl (good visibility in front) Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather) ABS/Air bag (see above) rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important) No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!) Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)  As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.    The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a  potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable. If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides differently (if that's ""better"" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine. Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).   I prefer cloth to leather anyway.    I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water  generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the Eagles (and I was really trying).   There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch"" but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO. And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!  Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the  water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

I am an American but I was raised in Europe, where the worst thing that  can happen to somebody is get his car broken into, or have his pocket picked by Slaves or Russian refugees.  Of cource there will be some nutcases, but thats extremely rare.  I.e. in Greece you can walk through any neighborhood at any time during the night without even worrying.  In Germany , you can walk the sidewalks at 4.00 am and not even look  behind your back, at the sanitation crews that clean the streets to a  sparkling cleen.  Whoever of you have been there you know what I am saying.  I dont have any easy answers but if we as a nation do some selfcritisism we might get somewhere.  Of course these postings sould be in soc.culture.US but if we reduce crime here it 'll mean less car insurance rates ,thus we could spend more money on modifing our cars.

I suspect you have very limited experience -- US freeways vary dramatically, particularly between states.  I can name a number of interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be very optimistic in any car.  I'm not sure what you call ""quite severe"" in terms of road deviations but I suspect every single bridge junction on I84 through CT would be considered so.  They're hard to take at 85mph.  That's not the only interstate I've seen with such deviations, but it's one I drive frequently.  Texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such wide-open spaces.  It just ain't so.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com","automotive"

The military surplus stuff I've driven -- ""Jeep Classic"" (Willys/Kaiser/AMC, pre-independent suspension) and Power Wagons (Slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup) weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and I wouldn't swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.  You just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at least the one they used to use.  Designed circa WW II as a compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high speeds on civilian roadways.  For those who can't remember what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. Oh, yeah, and narrow too. One of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus  Jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of the advancements made in ride and handling since D-Day.  But the point made by Wharfie and others still stands:  if you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 Power Wagon (or a Jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired vehicle) anywhere, I'd suggest the American interstate.   Your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.  Naturally, neither I nor my employer advocates unsafe or unlawful driving.  --Joe ""Just another personal opinion from the People's Republic of Berkeley""","automotive"

If you don't already know it, you should call the bank/credit union/ finance company that holds the loan on your present car and get the current payoff cost.  If you are trading in your current car on the new car, subtract the payoff amount from the trade-in the dealer is giving you.

The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but  lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was  defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below  market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average  retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but  the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the  Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the  fact that if you have an automobile that does not  depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive  to deal with you.  There is no way that the  manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and  sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded  a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's  representative at the hearing tends to support this  point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not  seem to take the proceeding very seriously.  I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am  getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have  to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon  myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on  the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to  my elected representatives telling them how utterly  ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for  a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.   As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying  for my insurance.  Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992  this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems  that required attention included the transmission,  heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main  problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They  could not install a non-defective transmission in at  least four attempts.  So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but  you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you  paid too much in the first place, or if your car  happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.  jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com ","automotive"

It's only been in the last year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature. VW assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.  VW is really hurting right now in the US market.  Check out the article in last week's Autoweek about the crisis at VW.  Golfs and Jettas will be coming from the plant in Mexico, but they don't have the quality at that facility.  As per normal VW practice, the US launch of the Jetta III is delayed again and again, until a good chunk of the useful life of the design is spent.  I think that Passats come from Germany, so there is not the same quality and availability issue.  It's a nice car with a nice engine. Whether VW will be a player in the US market in two year's time is a different question...  I'll leave the Passat / Camry flamewar for someone else.   ","automotive"

I'd driven it since the previous July, putting 20k miles on it.  The sensor light used to light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after I bought it.   My brother and I rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment, so I suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  Performance (hah, if you could call it that) did not change.  Perhaps emissions increased, but how much emissions could a CA-registered 3 cylinder engine produce? That was a neat car, I held the engine block easily in one hand!

Having a lot of experience with a '92 Grand Am coupe, I can firmly state that they do have a lot of outstanding qualities.  Very reliable throughout.  Great layout of controls and components.  Very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  They  look sharp inside and out.  The V6 that I drive has exceptional power and  drivability compared to other similar cars that I have driven.  All in all, it's a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle. Please don't knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with specific reasons why you feel that way.

Depending on how you plan to use your SUV, I might recommend also browsing Trailer Boats and one or more of those Pickup, Shotgun, and 4WD magazines.  The car rags mostly seem to consider recently graded pea gravel to be offroading and ten sacks of redwood chips to be a bedload.  Considering that most of these SUVs seem to be  used mostly as robust station wagons, that's probably not a bad approach, but if your applications are more demanding, pick your information sources accordingly.  Of the three vehicles on your short list (Explorer, 4Runner,  Pathfinder), I'd recommend the 4Runner as being closely based  on a rather robust pickup and the Explorer for being comfortably  carlike.  Don't know much about the Pathfinder.  Good luck, --Joe ""Just another personal opinion from the People's Republic of Berkeley""","automotive"

The MR2's engine is noisy at the best of times,  but not even a nice nose - it's one of those very ugly noises.  	I do an oil change every 2-3 months, and for about 2 months the engine noise sounds relatively quiet during driving and idling. At around the 3 month mark, after an oil change (I've been tracking this very thoroughly for months now) it starts to get that very disgusting noise, not so much during driving, but more so during idling.  	What's its problem?  	Also.. I don't know if it's just me, but if noticed a little performance drop. It just hasn't got the acceleration it used to.   	Any help/tips would be appreciated!!

Sold through Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.  Mark","automotive"

Thats why your car goes faster when you punch the holes in it. All that radiation gets on your engine and gives it ""pep"" (scientific term). You get more horsepower & torque too! If you don't know what HP & torque are, you can read mile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. Horsepower is how much power a horse can make pulling a Subaru, and torque is a name invented by Craftsman for a wrench.  -Steve ","automotive"

It's human nature to look at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have been a ceaseless part of our heritage.  Overall, life is better now than it ever was then.  It's just that random individual acts of violence have never been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never good enough to retain them all.    Steve Wall","automotive"

When that light goes on, I just take it to the delaer tell them ""It's that time"" and they work on it for 4 hou and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor) I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten. Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.    What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?  				- Thomas -  ****************************************************************************** *  E-Mail Address: 		  *  ""Give me an an army of West Point,      * *	TJZ6624@ZEUS.TAMU.EDU	  *   graduates and I'll win a battle...     * *				  *   Give me a handful of Texas Aggies,     * *  ""Creator of MOT POWER!""	  *   and I'll win a war.""                   * *				  *	  - Gen.

This kind of behavior is what I was shocked by in my 'experience'. For   crying out loud, how do these turkeys think they can talk to customers   this way and still stay in business? Again, I don't expect sales people to   bow, scrape, and grovel in my presence but I sure don't expect to be   abused either. I was very surprised by the way the sales people talked to   me and in other 'negotiating' sessions I overheard in neighboring sales   cubicles. Evidently, their success rate is high enough that they continue   to do business this way. There must be a lot of people out there who are   easy to intimidate.  On the other hand, I'm not sure about the 'one price, no haggling'   approach that Saturn and other are starting to use. I guess if their fixed   price is fair it's OK. Maybe the best approach is to do your homework   before you go in. Find out the invoice prices of the car, add a reasonable   profit for the dealer ($200-$300??), offer them that price and stick to   it. If they get abusive, just leave. Then, don't let them try to screw you   after the deal is agreed on.  Mark","automotive"

The dealer claims there is nothing wrong, even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them- selves while you are driving down the road.  The automatic shoulder restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along. She does not have the new, larger engine and is quite dissatisfied with its lack of power.  The MB wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems such as the Passat's electrical system.  She is also considering a Saab 9000 (add some letters).

They have a streak of meanness that runs much deeper and stronger than anything I ever experienced even during the height of the 60's racial struggles.  I am absolutely convinced that there are kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that have ever walked the earth.  They will prevail unless the rest of humanity decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their own protection.  In a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.

My query is, - why does the noise get noticeably LOUDER about 2-3 months after an oil change. I just find it a bit wierd that this happens. Is it the oil I'm using (Mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3S-GE version/model) ie. gets noiser the older the oil is (I'm only guessing).

Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel Vehicles  To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters  Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806     WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a ""driving force behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative fuel vehicles and fuel supplies.""    President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.    President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.    ""I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make this happen,"" O'Leary said.  ""As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural gas vehicles in speeches across the country.""    The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending a plan and schedule of implementation.    ""The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,"" O'Leary said.  ""Increased use of domestically-produced alternative fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy economy are complimentary goals.""    O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make fleet conversions practical.    Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely available.  -30- -- Canada Remote Systems - Toronto, Ontario 416-629-7000/629-7044","automotive"

This suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  Years ago in another time and place, I used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive engines.  In many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various floation chambers on each side.  And if you *did* get something there, you'd spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.  So we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out the dipstick hole.  There was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  I'm sure these gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.  Mart L.

Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out  dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale (ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops, or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated value controlled by market forces.

Your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning. You may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire - so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road.  (2) Tires age. In particular, soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles. Harder compounds don't grip as well as soft ones.

You'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an SHO--the Taurus is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...  I went back and checked the article again; The SHO Wagon is quicker than the SHO automatic, but significantly slower than the REAL SHO.  Why anyone would order an SHO with an automatic transmission is beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a regular Taurus and leave the SHO to real drivers. That is not to say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an SHO anyway.   I would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic transmissions from all ""performance-type"" cars (like the 5.0l Mustangs, Camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of accidents each year.

I explained that I wanted a car just like the one I drove, but in a different color.  He said he could get one exactly like I wanted from the dealer network within a day.  We then negotiated a price and signed the deal.  Next day, I get a call.  He explains that they goofed, and they had neglected to take into account a price increase. (The last price increase had occurred over 4 months prior to my visit.)  If I still wanted the car, I would have to fork over another $700.  As an alternative, they would honor the price if I bought the car I test drove (which had been sitting around for  6 months and had a few miles on it). I said goodbye.  This was a good example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  It's too bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would no longer be in business.    The next dealership I went to was straightforward and honest.  First thing the salesman said was, ""Lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out how much profit I should make.""  The deal went through with no problems.  					Steve  ","automotive"

On the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the ""electronic"" odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  These pulses are  converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer. No way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage reading.  It also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to change as any other mechanical odometer.  On the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple switch will do the job.  It also will disable the speed limiter, which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)   --  Alan L.

Here in the states, people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of 50+mph.  I don't think this is because they are stupid (of course, there are exceptions), they are just programmed because of the 55mph limit. Do you (in the states) when you look in the rear-view ALWAYS calculate future  positions of cars based on a 50+ speed differential.   >Dont get me wrong, I love to drive in the left lane fast but when I overtake >cars who are on the right, I slow down a tad bit. If I were to rely on the judgement of the other car, to recognize the speed differential, I would be the stupid one.    just to satiate my curiosity, why would this make you the stupid one?  It seems to me, everybody SHOULD be aware enough of what is going on.  You do not need to calculate the future position.  You need to look at your mirrors a little more.  If you glance around, you will be able to tell how much faster than you the car is going.  Maybe not precisely, but well enough to know if you should let him around before you try to pass.  I know what you are talking about, about the other driver being startled, because i myself have been startled by drivers cruising by at around 90-100mph when i'm doin 55-65.  The problem, though, as i saw it, was not their fault for barreling around me, but my fault for not paying the attention to my task-at-hand that i should have been. Oddly enough, since the 2nd time(happened 2x in around 4 mo. when i'd had my liscence for around 6 mo), i haven't been startled..and i've been passed by cars doing roughly twice the speed of my car.  Another odd occurance is the fact that this only seems to happen on LONG trips...and if i drive along with them, it doesn't happen at all :-) even on the long trips! :-)  (adrenaline will do that to you...i've had bad cop experiences with speeding, so anything over the limit is adrenalizing for me...scared i'll get caught :-)  Maybe they should raise the limit, so we can pay better attention.....  just curious, and my .otwo  DREW","automotive"

Frankly, the Saturn way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. I hadn't bought a new car since I bought my Honda 4WD back in '85, and I was unbelieveably offended by most salespeople I met.  Saturn was indeed very different. I made three different visits to the dealer where I bought my car, and was never pressured. Saturn also had the best after-sales support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what I wanted to buy. Another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the dealer. He's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a Saturn, based on what he's seen and heard from his customers.   Saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60K miles,  fully refunded if you don't use it. That works out to an actual cost of $170 or so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. Using savings account rates it's more like $120. In the first three years it also buys you free rental during any warranty work, without counting against the refund.  --mike  ","automotive"

My '79 Honda Accord with 110,000 miles on it started   showing the same behavior.  I replaced the brake master cylinder myself.  It took about an hour and cost   about $45.  Sure beats paying $300 to have someone else do it!  If I wanted to   rebuild my own master cylinder instead of putting in a rebuilt one, it would   have cost only $20 to $30 for the rebuild kit.  The Honda brake master cylinder is easy to get to.  Two bolts attach it to the   engine compartment.  Two brake lines enter the master cylinder.  The tricky   part was that the brake lines were stuck tight.  My Craftsmen open end wrench   rounded off the bolt heads!  I had to use Vise Grips to loosen those suckers.    Wow!  Best invention since sliced bread.  After that it was very easy.  Bolt   the new part in place, add new brake fluid, and bleed the brakes.  This is quite easy even for a beginner.  My local auto parts store had a repair   manual for the Honda Accord; it had detailed diagrams of the master brake   cylinder and a step-by-step procedure for replacing it.","automotive"

They shift *better* than I do, there's no clutch to wear out (Honda wanted $800 for my 4WD wagon last year!- got it done for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)  (Oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the  Motor City- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on  manual.

More than that. GEICO funded the company that developed LIDAR. When locals    showed a reluctance to BUY the units, GEICO started giving them away. I   know they've given units to the Florida Highway Patrol, County Sheriff's a   and some local governments. The real question is why? This is the hook. GEICO, and other Ins. Co.s can   tell which drivers represent risk. This is a determination they can make   AFTER YOU receive a speeding ticket from one of GEICO's LIDAR units. Most   drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but    this gives them the opportunity to RAISE RATES FOR EQUAL RISK. It's called   extra profits. They also know how silly the NSL is, and how it is almost   universally ignored. Driving in excess of the NSL gets you a ticket, an   increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you   a riskier driver to insure. Like the sound of this? Like the people who thought up the scheme? Go GEICO!  Unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go with one of the major companies and stay there. You'll get long term customer discounts on your premiums. Now, about the % of your premium that is paid as commission. That's another story for another day.","automotive"

Do you think our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys and indians?  I don't think so.  That behavior was somewhat encouraged back then, in fact. I think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when some teenager kills another one in a classroom in California, we here  about it in MA the same day.  Back in the old days, they'd never hear  about something like that, period.

If the Valentine sa ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo re than likely to be a speed trap. With my other detectors, I've gotten so many  falses that I've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because I didn't want t o drive like I had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.  That directional indicator really, really helps. Plus, more info is almost alwa ys better than less info. No matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br ain is usually smarter. So, if I'm going to make a decisio based on information  at hand, I want all the info I can get. Plus, if you divide the overall streng th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. With other detectors, yo u'll just get one strong warning. My logic may be faulty on this, but I think i t works okay.

My current car is a convertible. IMHO, if you're after that 'convertible feel', T-Tops, open-top, sunroofs, moonroofs, whatever, just don't cut it.  There's no substitute for a convertible.  If you're not after that sun beating down on you, the wind in your hair and teeth, the flopsum and jetsum getting in the car and the noises associated with the whooshing of the wind, you're not after that 'convertible feel'.

It's got enough power for fun, it's RWD like a sports car ought to be (I'm gonna regret that :-{) and the top, while manual, operates like a dream. 30 seconds and one hand to lower, and not much longer to raise.

My previous car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others.  The locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking nut.  I always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no one ever did the service correctly. I eventually got rid of the locking lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  Unfortunately, I found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after I got rid of the locking nuts. :-(  My present car, a Saturn SC, has locking lugnuts that I bought at the dealer and are made specifically for the Saturn.  They have been made to be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the package and I verified it myself).  I haven't had any vibration problems with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  I did have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire balancing.

Diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  The main reason they are considered ""cleaner"" is because they are better at the emissions we actually measure and regulate.  But they also contribute additional emissions which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or limits have been defined.    Current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  Diesel particulates are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  And alcohols emit signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  The evidence is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.  And anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in rush hour traffic in some cities in Europe.  There the stench of the diesels is awful and it can even burn the eyes.    Diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.   Mark","automotive"

What you described SOUNDS the same to me.  In fact, what little & i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as ""dogs"" & and said they were synonymous.  The gears are always meshed in a synchronized & gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. Or at least, & that is what i was taught.  Explain, por favour?  Motorcycle transmissions don't have synchros.  The engagment dogs are very corse and sloppy.  There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the gears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back and forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the clutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If  you try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into the next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn't a neutral between gears (obviously there is, but you can't select it with the shifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  ""speed shifting"" (which is what I have always heard ""clutchless shifting"" called) works pretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the clutch-especially for the lower gears.  I think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the engagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of syncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions that are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse and sometimes first).    -- Frank Ball   1UR-M          frankb@sad.hp.com    (707) 794-4168 work, Hewlett Packard             (707) 794-3844 fax,  (707) 538-3693 home 1212 Valley House Drive     IT175, XT350, Seca 750, '62 F-100, PL510 Rohnert Park CA 94928-4999  KC6WUG, LAW, AMA, Dod #7566, I'm the NRA.","automotive"

What I was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very HIGH speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  I have had some VERY scary instances when I assumed this and I dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)  ok.  I can agree to this, because, as we have both proved, what is ideally SUPPOSED to happen, isn't always.  And even though i'm rearely the one doing the passing, i don't see where it makes you stupid, but i agree, that if you  think you are SAFE, because the other guy is SUPPOSED to have been paying  attention, then yes, you are just as dumb as the other(maybe dumber?) hasta DREW","automotive"

Furthermore, you are obviously not a smoker; on a cold day, it takes a certain skill to toss a butt out of a cracked window without having it wind-deflect into the back seat.  Also, just 'cause some smokers use the window, doesn't mean all of us do.

These, I will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake continental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies  try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion in the way.

Thanks for any info.  >Mike Davis  I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use   S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough  to test for wear, but some people I know have.     A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50 he has went 5 years without an overhaul.  Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be expected of 30K miles not 200K.  In my opinion it works. ______________________________________________________________________________ Beware!

My screams intensify as I finally emerge from under the car, and I struggle to my feet in front of the car, whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant. Then the engine seizes, but not before the cylinder head explodes, piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron.  This happens every time. I'm starting to think I should pay the mechanic $25 instead paying the hospital $250,000 and the dealer $25,000 for a new car. This gets costly when you change the oil every 3000 miles.  - Toadface","automotive"

All opinions, benchmarks, >>>recommendations, etc. are welcome.  The Civic does still come in a 4 door model.  My wife and I looked quite seriously at the 626, Prizm (Corolla), and Civic, as well as some other cars.  Our impressions: all three seemed well built and had the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are considering anti-lock brakes.  I also hate automatic seatbelts and we both think having an airbag is a plus.  In general, comfort and performance were both significant.  Some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.  Mazda 626  + very comfortable and roomy  + can theoretically get ABS on DX model, though in practice this is    hard to find  + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:    tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat  - more expensive than many other cars listed below  Honda Civic  + DX gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here  + comfortable front seat  + adjustable seat belt mounting  - no ABS without EX model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)  Geo Prizm/Toyota Corolla  - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)  + adjustable seat belt mounting  + can get ABS without lots of other extras  Saturn  + SL2 was quite comfortable, though SL1 less so  - motorized attack belts  Dodge Spirit    no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok  - rear seat does not fold down  Chevy Corsica  + comes with ABS standard  - lower ""would you buy that car again"" and safety ratings in    Consumer Reports (than first 3 cars above)  - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +    for some)  The Honda Accord and Toyota Camry were both more expensive than the 626, and in our minds, not significantly better.  We probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the ""big 3"", due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of Chrysler products, (b) some unimpressive GM products owned by my parents and a housemate of mine (c) the Taurus comes with automatic transmission, I find the seat of the Tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts and no air bag.  We'll probably end up with a 626 - I saw a 626 DX with A/C and cassette advertised for just under $12800 (Washington Post, April 14, I think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  I will probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  The main question in my mind is whether or not I will have to do a ""factory order"" or ""preference order"" to get one with ABS, and whether or not the dealership will run the price up a lot if I do so.","automotive"

The older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.  Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study. My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm not sure, but I think Tioyota went to a full-time 4WD or all-wheel drive system. The older Landcruisers have a ""lock-up"" type. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.  	Paul Hovnanian	hovnania@atc.boeing.com 	[Std disclaimers apply]","automotive"

You raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  You could buy a Volvo, Saab, or 'Benz and get really good crash protection (and other luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  In my case it's out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.  Even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  Nowadays, at least in the US, you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an added safety benefit there as well.  That's something I certainly look for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.  My $.02, of course.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com","automotive"

The big win with the V-1 is not its range but rather its directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later called a ""gimmick"" -- a conclusion I disagree with).  Since the detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's significantly more expensive.

I certainly call it ""interesting"" but I'm another person who thinks that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  Very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well.  If I did more long-distance travelling in areas I'm not familiar with I'd probably consider getting the V-1 because it's additional information would be useful in discriminating false alarms.  jim frost jimf@centerline.com","automotive"

Turned out  that the actual reading should have been 160K. Court case followed because lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. Dealer found  quilty, fined and had to take back the car.  I think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous owner. Take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.  - gerrit","automotive"

BTW, Talking with the dealer I bought the car from got me nowhere.  After being routed to a ""Firebird Specialist"", I was able to confirm that this is in fact the case.  At first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio. She wouldn't go into any details, so I don't know if there were some shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  As I say, she was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this, feel free to respond.  Supposedly, this problem is now solved.  Second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related to the six-speed Manual transmission.  So as of this posting, there is a production hold on these cars.  She claimed part of the delay was not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore having to wait for the right high quality parts...  I'm not positive that this applies to the Camaro as well, but I'm guessing it would.  Can anyone else shed some light on this?

Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics! Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-) Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics.   >And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Unfortunately, Ford has this with Most Probes and does not have a recall for it.  Very dissatisfying to say the least.  >2) Where are the drain holes located for the hatch?  There is no drain holes that I know of.  I used a margine tub to drain it Regretably I waited three months as I was short cash and they wouldn't fix it under warrantee.  Then I paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in  the trunk.  This resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would not retract.  So I ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced;  $90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket which I insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that when I proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the  covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.  very annoying.  Don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay more later.

I have no idea how either of my Hondas will handle at 100+ mph, nor do they reach 155. However, using `high' to be 70-90 mph:  a) They are quite amenable to long high speed drives. I've done several 1k mile+ trips in my Civic with no problems whatsoever. The last big trip I made was driving from New York to Texas. I remember driving 700-800 miles a day at typically 75-85 mph  without any problems. I'm sure I   would have been more comfortable driving a benz, but no white knuckles. No problems with winds and curves.   Then there was the trip back from New Orleans after Mardi Gras - where we were doing 80+ all the way to Houston. No problems.  b) Both my cars have surprising good fuel economy at high speeds. I see no difference between sustained 60 mph and sustained 80mph. On the trip back from New Orleans, we got about 30 mpg in my Integra, quite ok. Mind you, the engine revs to almost 4k at 80. The civic is markedly better than the Integra in fuel economy. 50k miles down the road, I still get 35 mpg at 70-75 mph driving.   >|> b) I can't understand why these high-scale European marquees are afraid >|>    to design engines that can be repeatedly revved to near redline in >|>    the low gears.

'89s go for about $15K, '90s go for perhaps 1 or 2K more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25K if you can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never rust.  in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year old and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200K out of one is not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  then there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...  if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about everything too..  the price of parts is a different story though...   eliot","automotive"

This is a tricky situation; if the previous owner didn't inform the dealer of the odometer change, then the previous owner committed fraud, and he may be liable. The dealer may also be liable; If the previous owner notified the dealer, or if the previous owner had the  dash replaced at a dealer, or if the previous owner had the dash changed  legally, any records search on the car should turn up the fact that the odometer had been altered.  If a dealer changes the speedometer, he has to report it (it goes into the car's service record with the manufacturer, and on the title, if I remember correctly; the dealer told me that the old mileage, etc. were sent to Ford when my T-Bird's speedo  was replaced). If the odometer can be set to the old mileage, it must  be; if it can't (eg, electrically-driven odometers) then the mileage  of the old odometer must be written on a permanent sticker which is  affixed to the door frame of the vehicle.   Either way, if the change had been done legally, then a records search (which the dealer almost certainly did) should have turned it up.

Sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. The pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. Locate the fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a normal idle. If so, locate the diaphram and test it. If you can't apply suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

They are available and cheap (about $500 in the USA).  Add to that four or five or six point belts and you will walk away from collisions that were otherwise not survivable.  but instead of people spending a little extra money, we get legislation that says the gov't must mandate a minimal level of protection for everyone.   One other significant factor in improving one's own safety is to get some training.  This will improve your safety more than any other single investment will.  Drive/ride defensively (and that does not mean you have to be a doddering old stick in the mud).  People here tend to enthuse about autos more than the average (probably in the top 15th percentile in driving ability), but still we sometimes overlook the obvious.  I've been to two driving schools, and three riding schools for my motorcycle.  A very worthwhile investment (and besides, it was a lot of fun too ;-).   Safety is what you make of it, just because a carmaker doesn't provide you with an adequate level of protection doesn't mean you have to leave it go at that.    --  Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA ""Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?""                                              -Mary Chapin-Carpenter","automotive"

Rich, 	First of all you might want to join the VetteNet (vettes@chiller.compaq 	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about  	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  This means that the car may 	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver 	and or hobby car.  You will also want to get a copy of the Corvette 	Black Book immediately.  Don't leave home (to look at Vettes) without it. 	Since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a 	few hours in reading the ""Corvette Buyer's Guide"" and purchase Noland 	Adams' tape ""How to Buy a Corvette.""  The tape shows you how to check 	for damage, etc..  There are many many factors that will affect the 	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  The 	list is much too long to go into here.  Join the VetteNet where 	there are over 100 current Corvette owners (many with 60s vintage 	vettes) that are available to help you.  The pubs I mentioned above 	are available from Mid-America Designs (800) 637-5533 and several 	other Corvette parts sources.  Good luck!!! 	 	Tom   ('68 327/350hp - '79 Cruiser)","automotive"

An On/Off Road Rally consists of the following:     1. An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of       directions and clues guiding participates around the        Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course       based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which       they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the       number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately        lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is        set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.     2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.       Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles       without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle       unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified       4x4s can run the course.         At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring   participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.   Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.  * This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper   from their vehicle :) .  The Particulars:  * Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.     (815)436-9382   (see map below) * Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m. * Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine * There is an entry fee of $10 per truck. * You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed) * A valid drivers license is required * Suggested equipment:       CB Radio       Compass       Tow Strap and Clevis       Clip Board and Pencil * No alcohol during rally * For more information contact    Gary (815)727-3415    Tom  (815)485-9346    Norm Jr. (815)741-4853    Brian (708)979-6083                                               __               Instant                      /\       |       Replay |             |         \       | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North       |<----->|   | <------------> |  Rt30 |       |___|  |             | ------|---------------------------------------------  Exit |              |             |         ^  257  |              |             |         |       |              |             |         |       |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |       |              |Farm         |Ave      |       |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.       |              |             |         |       |              |             |         |       |                            |         |       |                            |         |       |       Rt80                 |         v ----------------------------------------------------       |                            | Exit       |                            | 130B       |                            |    ","automotive"

Don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing. Take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.

Roads like the Autobahn are smoother, straiter, wider and slightly banked.   Example: A few months back I was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so) and I was changing highways at a bent crosssing. It  curved off to the south east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the left strait north. I wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled into the crossing and checked the north lane. Nevertheless there wasn't  a car in sight, so I took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane. Now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but I was in the corect lane and  over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 I wasn't wasting time. It was then that I checked my mirror and saw a Mustang closing in my lane *FAST*, he  had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. Luckly he saw me and  changed lanes in time, I estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so. I was just a by stander, I had no chance of runing from him, or moving out  of his way. I'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. I shudder to  think of what would have happened had I wainted to pull out and not  left the time he needed to dodge me.

I've been doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck I've got over 150k. I've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission. My experiences suggest otherwise. What techniques do you use?  On some old pieces of junk I drove, the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless. To date I've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. Some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker & easier they where to shift.  My technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever. If for some reason I miss the shift window, I lightly press the accelerator & try agian. I've found that clutchless shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). I also skip gears some times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.   krispy","automotive"

You know, I'm a Ford fan, I must say, so I'm looking forward to the next Mustang.  I have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable than the Camaro is now.  You know, that's MHO.    The differences these days between Ford and GM are not so much the quality, just the philosophy.  It used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  GM is barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that can only be made up in time.  STSs still come off the assembly line with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments; it's those 75 year old plants.  And the latest GM products still come with the standard equipment RattleDash (tm).  But like I said, they're getting better and making the move in the right direction.  They beat Ford to the market with the Camaro/Firebird, but really only in words.  Production of these vehicles will be limited until the end of the year, keeping selling prices above MSRP for the most part since there are so many twitching Camaro fans out there.  I wouldn't press Ford to hurry the Mustang since the final wait could be worth it. Besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the Mustang anyway.  I do not put much stock in the mag rags' ""inside"" information, or even Ford rep quotes.  The Taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it's entirety.  ""Inside"" information had the Taurus with a V8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  I wouldn't look for a simple re-paneled Mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself if you do.  There's a lot of potential.  Ford hasn't released a new car without a 4-wheel IS in 7 years.  The Mustang project has been brewing for at least 4, right?  A 4-wheel IS could happen.  Those modular V8's are out there, too.  In the interest of CAFE and competition, don't rule those out, either.   Your ignorant if you do. And there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there, who really knows what it'll look like?  The Mach III?  Doubt it. Highly.  The next Mustang will be Ford's highest profile car.  It attracts way more attention than the Camaro/Firebird because it's heritage is more embedded in the general public.  Don't lie to yourself and believe Ford will forfeit that.  I submit that the Mustang will be a success.  Enough to elicit defensive remarks from some heavy Camaro fans here.  You know, intelligent, critical spews like, ""The Mustang bites, man!""  Some of you are already beginning.  I predict that the Mustang and Camaro will be comparable performers, as usual.  I predict that the differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual. The Camaro is still a huge automobile; the Mustang will retain its cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  The Camaro still reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the Mustang will appeal to the driver.  The Camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while the Mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set. Both will be more refined (I do think the Camaro is).  There will be no clear winner.  Unless the Ford gets the 32v, 300hp Romeo.  You don't seriously believe that it was designed for the Mark VIII only, do you?  :^)  Regards,  Brian  bqueiser@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I am the engineer, I can choose K. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Department of Engineering Mechanics Ohio State University Columbus, OH","automotive"

As a result, when you stop for a light the motor stalls.  Putting the car in park, and waiting for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to ""reset"" and go back into 1st.  Otherwise, it just stalls when put in drive.    My thoughts:  Either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  The least likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).  My background is that my father owns a service station and I worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.

I have noticed a few problems with the car :  	1. It gives very low gas mileage (something like            11 miles / gallon ; I hear other car owners speak of            gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).  	2.

I would like to know if there is any way by which I can fix these problems. Or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has done about 117,000 miles). Someone suggested that I change/rebuild/ recondition the carburettor. I am not prepared to do it unless I am sure it will fix the problem. And yes, I got the car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).  Please let me know if you have any suggestions. Please respond by email since I don't scan this newsgroup regularly.

The technology Cummins is applying to diesels to comply with the newer Ca. emissions laws involves three things I know of:  1. All compliant diesels are turbocharged. 2. All use an ""aftercooler"", which cools the air which was heated    by compression by the turbocharger (up to about 25 PSI). 3. A gismo on the injector pump which senses the pressurized air    intake, and limits full delivery of fuel while the pressure is    low.  No scrubbers, catalytic converters, etc, are used.  The path from the turbocharger to the exhaust outlet is kept very free.  Interestingly, except for the low-pressure fuel limitation, power output  and mileage are enhanced by these measures.  One can buy aftermarket turbos and aftercoolers which generate more power, lots more power, and these are approved by the CARB.  Dan Hepner","automotive"

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater  feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and 140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every  respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.  The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000 kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.  Jeff Goss","automotive"

Indeed.)  the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.  i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free, though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of recent hondas can approach.   eliot","automotive"

Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when the converter gets into its operating range).  The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car.

Don't lie to yourself and >believe Ford will forfeit that.   The car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new Mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my ""car circle"" is that the  suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current Cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior. After the MN12 (Thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, Ford decided  independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in  a volume car.    The current 4.9l V-8 will soldier on for about two years.  A version of the 32 valve modular V-8 in the Mark VIII could be offered then.  Ford is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l V-6 engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably do not consider volume production of 300 hp V-8 engines a priority.   Undisguised, the car looks OK, but not nearly as exciting as the new Camaro/Firebird, IMO.    I suspect Ford will produce their car with higher quality than GM will  achieve with the Camaro/ Firebird.  The way GM loses money, the temptation to ""just get them out the door"" for the sake of positive cash flow will be  great once demand really takes off.    Tim Gardner  ","automotive"

This is a very simplistic view of safety. Assuming that you are in a collision (less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. This is why a thousand pound F1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why everybody dies when a Suburban hits a wall at 35 (as I recall for the last generation Suburban HIC numbers).   As an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? It seems to me that seatbelts with pretensioners (Audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt  will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. You might be  saved from some flyign glass? Or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are wearing no seat belt?   Craig > >- gerrit >  ","automotive"

Keywords: clutch master cyl problems  I have both an '84 and an '86 Camry, each with manual 5-speed transmissions. The '84 has about 105,000 miles on it and the '86 about 83,000 miles.  ABout a year ago I found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the '84 was         leaking fluid around the piston seal, leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car.  I pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit (new plunger, seal, etc.) and thought I had the problem licked.  Much to my surprise, the same problem developed several months later!  This time I looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches, burrs, or other obvious causes of the problem.  I didn't find any.  Ever since I have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system.  I knew I would be selling the car and didn't want to go all the way to solving the problem.  I should add that the clutch is original, and that I've had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch.  My hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal, the angle of the piston rod (attached to the pedal) is off the axix of the cylinder, thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it.  What do you think of that as an explanation?  Can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in?  Now the '86: same problem, except that the above diagnosis doesn't explain why all of the fluid leaked out (by way of the master cylinder, into the passenger compartment) while I was on vacation for 10 days, during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort.  What can you suggest here?  Many thanks.  Let's hope I don't end up going to Click and Clack on this...  Bill Christens-Barry cerulean@access.digex.com ","automotive"

I have been interested in buying a SHO for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in Denver and Chicago every week.  I bought a remarkably clean maroon/red SHO with 92K miles on it for $6800. As far as I can tell, this is about $2000 under Blue Book and I still have another 8000 miles before the Extended Service Plan runs out.      As one should with any pre-1991 SHOs, I made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate, as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments. However, my SHO does not have the newer rod shifter -- I understand I can get this for $230 from any Ford service center.  In addition, the car received the full tune-up at 60K miles, receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment.      For a car with 92K miles on it, the car was virtually immaculate. The clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents, although the front air-dam/molding was covered with lots of small scratches -- not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway.      Having driven a smaller two-door coupe for so long, I was a bit concerned about whether I could get used to driving a larger car.  To my surprise, the size of the car doesn't bother me at all -- it seems just as nimble as my Celica!  (No comparisons with my Oldsmobile.  :-) Visibility from the driver's seat is excellent, helped mostly by of the small the quarter-windows, aft of the back-seat door windows and in front of the C-pillar and rear window.  Parallel parking is a bit more difficult, but other than that, I love the size.      In fact, I'm starting to appreciate the large trunk as I pack up for a 14-hour drive to Washington, DC for the summer.  More on the ride later in this review.   Engine:          As with anyone even slightly interested in SHOs, I was very interested in the 24-valve 3.0L Yamaha ""Shogun"" engine.  I was not disappointed.  Base performance of the engine under 4000 rpms is good.  You can even do reasonable launches from second gear, although I don't make a practice of this.  The engine revs smoothly and eagerly -- tooling around town does not require many shifts.  This is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car. (More on this later.)      While the performance of the engine under 4000 rpms may be unremarkable, it undergoes a Jekyll/Hyde transformation once you hit higher revs.  At 4500 rpms, a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up.  The engine soars to its 7000 rpm redline, and you are treated to, in my opinion, the sweetest sounding V6 around. The engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED to be at 6500 rpm!      I've noticed that when I drive around town, I constantly watch the tach to see how far below 4000 rpm I am.  To go from 2000 rpm to 4000, you may have to punch the accelerator -- while torque is more than adequate, it doesn't come fully online until those other 12 valves are used.   Transmission:      When _Car and Driver_ first reviewed the car in 1988, they marvelled at how Ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car.  I remember driving a friend's parent's SHO in 1990, and remember thinking about whether I had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic -- the clutch was that stiff.  That was back then.      The entire clutch assembly on my SHO has been replaced under a Ford recall in 1991.  The clutch on the SHO feels no stiffer than the one on my Toyota Celica.  In fact, the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving.      When playing with the shifter with the car parked, the shifter felt very reasonable.  The 1-2 and 3-4 gates were where you'd expect it to be, and the shifting action was smooth.  On the road, it's much the same -- but you have to shift SLOWLY!  Make no mistake, it's a clumsy shifter.      When hurrying shifts, like when I was initially trying to impress friends, I consistently miss the 1-2 shift, often grope clumsily for the 2-3 shift, and sometimes even muff the 3-4 shift.  I find this pretty amazing in a car like this.      It also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time.  Seems obvious, but compared to my Toyota and my friend's Honda, this seems atrocious and clumsy. Someone on rec.autos noted that CRXs should blow SHOs off-the-line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter.      I now shift much more sedately, and the shifter seems more reasonable.  When you play within these bounds, the shifter works smoothly with no surprises.  I don't know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all.      Along these same lines, I initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly.  Again, slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely.  This took several days for me to get the hang of.  (I think some of my problems were because I've never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears.)      Occasionally, I have trouble shifting into reverse.  The shifter refuses to enter the gate, and I often grind the synchros trying to  get it into gear.  I'll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months.      A quirk:  When I upshift and the engine drops back to 1000-2500 rpm, I hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment.  Not terribly loud, but the passenger can definitely hear it.  I asked about it when I was looking at the car, as do all my passengers.  Apparently, this is a definitely a ""SHO sound"" and is the gearbox -- apparently called ""gear rollover"". Replies to my queries on rec.autos are at the end of this review.   Exterior:      As I mentioned before, I am astounded by how well the body of this SHO has stood up.  Paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non-existent.  Looking at how older Tauri sometimes don't age so gracefully, I wonder what the guys at Ford did differently to the SHO bodies.      The body, in my opinion, is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock Tauri.  For some odd reason, the SHO seems different enough from vanilla Tauri to get stares at stoplights -- of course, this could be my overactive imagination. :-)  SHOs get fog lights, a more open grille, a completely monochromatic exterior, and a deeper ground skirt in the back with ""SHO"" stenciled in relief.  I've seen a couple SHOs whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black.  Yuck.      I don't think the car is flashy.  I like it that way.  I feel almost anonymous with all those Tauri out there, but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care.  :-)   Interior:      The interior is what really makes me feel like I don't deserve the car.  The seats are grey leather, the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather, and the entire instrument panel is done in a black/grey/metallic scheme.        The instrumentation is stock Taurus, except for the 140 mph speedo and 8000 rpm tach.  You get a center console with two cupholders, a large compartment under the radio (great for a CD player), an armrest that contains yet another compartment, three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways (I think), and a compartment for holding cassette tapes.  There's map-holders in the doors, and an oddly small glove compartment.      I spilled a whole can of Coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink.  Hey, I'm really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design.  And it's a 1989, before the interior was upgraded!      The backseat is bigger than any car I've had.  Why do they need so much space?  :-)  (No smart-ass comments, please.  :-)      The driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters.  From what I hear, it's not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear. Mine is no exception.  The left side bolster on the driver's has cracked and I'm not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way.      A big surprise for me:  I forgot that SHOs don't have a normal hand parking brake.  Instead, they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot.  Too bad.  Again, I'm getting used to it, but it seems a bit anachronistic to me.   Ride:      The suspension is nice and stiff.  Too stiff?  It's stiffer than any car I've had.  A friend's new 1993 Toyota Celica ST seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better.  The SHO seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps.  Driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair.  On the other hand, taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn't flex at all -- I listened for that before I bought the car.      On the highway, the ride is great.  When I drove the car from Chicago back to Purdue, I had trouble keeping under 85 mph, let alone from trying to see what 100 mph really feels like.  It's a relatively quiet ride, but the sunroof rattles.  I've tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there, but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails.  No easy way to get rid of it, I think.      Over the past three days, I've oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough.  (Not for me, mind you.  But I wonder whether I would advise my dad to buy one for himself.)  But, I've discovered, as with the shifter, if you take your time with shifts, you'll have no reason to complain.  Let me explain...      The ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels.  I feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right.  After I understood this, I avoid the limits of traction -- and I'm a happy camper again.      It's not body rigidity, but the composure of the car.      As if matching the suspension, the steering feel is quite heavy. My first impression of driving my SHO was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds.  It tracks straight as an arrow, but when driving around a parking lot, the high-effort steering didn't seem so useful.  However, it's reasonable, but it doesn't communicate the road to the driver as well as a 1993 Ford Probe GT.  IMHO, it's much better than the steering on my Celica ST.      I wonder how bad this car is during winter?   Miscellaneous notes:      GRIPES:      The rattles from the sunroof is intermittent -- some days it rattles         loudly, other days I look up wondering where all the noise went.      Activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy -- loud squealing as 	it retracts on its rails.  I wonder if there is a quick fix for this. 	Again, other days it completely disappears.  (Function of humidity?)      Once I made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension 	and torque steer, I've never complained about ride.      I wish the seats had more support under the thighs.  Also, I wish the 	side bolsters would close more tightly.        I hear that tires for this car can get really expensive.  I 	currently have Goodyear GT+4s that cost the previous owner $500 	for four.      I used to hate the Ford stereo systems -- whose idea was it 	to use a volume *paddle*?  Now, to my amazement, I don't 	really mind...  and sometimes think it's an okay idea!!! 	Pretty ridiculous, though.      Getting up to 4000 rpm sometimes seems to be a chore.  But, 	this is no big deal.  There is more than enough torque 	down low.      I often goof up the shifting when driving with friends.  It 	took me a couple of days before I could really shift 	smoothly from 2nd to 3rd gear.  (Hard to believe, isn't it?)      My car has almost 93,000 miles on it.  My parents noted that 	it is almost impossible to find a low-mileage SHO.  	Astute observation, IMHO.  I wonder how long I can make 	my SHO last -- I just bought a book titled ""Drive It Forever"" 	for tips in this department.  :-)      The goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop.  I once 	parked the car in gear, and then accidentally let out the clutch 	after I started it.  The car jolted forward, and bounced off 	the car in front of me -- no paint damage at all, but starting the car  	is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal!  Also, I began  	to wonder how strong that brake really is.  (Today, I backed out of  	parking spot today and started to drive away before I noticed  	the glowing brake light.  Oops.)      The driver's power window creaks when closed all the way.  The same     	thing happens in my parents 1989 Mercury Sable.  Oddly, all the 	other windows work smoothly.       LIKES:      I'm liking the interior amenities more and more each day.  The     	cupholders are great.      I didn't expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much, but 	it really is handy.  You can lock all the doors by 	pressing the 7/8 and 9/10 buttons together!  Neat!  And 	you can never lock yourself out of the car.      I really feel like I don't deserve this car.  I really can't 	believe that I could afford it.  I got this car ten years  	ahead of schedule.  :-)      I love this car so much that I've been telling my parents to 	look into buying one.  I love this car so much that I 	wrote this 13K file -- I meant to write a couple of lines 	and ended up with this.        If there were a J.D. Powers Survey for used car owners, I would have 	an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this  	car.  I don't like thinking about getting another car, but at this 	point in time, I'm sure I'd buy another SHO.  For under $7000, you 	can't beat it.  (Next time with an airbag and ABS, though.)      Insurance-wise, this car is also a big win.  I pay the same premiums 	as on my 1987 Toyota Celica -- despite that it has nearly twice 	the horsepower.      Other Odds and Ends:      Much to my amazement, there is no SHO mailing list anywhere. Maybe because the _SHO Registry_ publication has filled this void.  I haven't joined yet, but I've noticed that queries about SHOs still appear on rec.autos about once a month.  Owners of SHOs are always quick to respond, and are very vocal fans of the cars.  (Maybe some of the most vocal on rec.autos.  :-)      I've put together the responses to my questions about the cars, as well as other posts with useful information on these cars.  I'll be  posting this in the form of a FAQ soon.        If anyone is interested in starting a mailing list, please speak up! I don't know if I have the resources here at Purdue to start one, but  maybe someone out there does.   Gene Kim (genek@mentor.cc.purdue.edu)  ","automotive"

I recently found out that there are two versions of the GLI -- 8v and 16v. I know of three differences between the two cars that both carry the same name:  the 16v version has 20 more horsepower, 4 wheel discs, and a standard sunroof.  Oops, that's the difference between the GLI 16v and the regular GL !! So in addition to the engine, what other differences exist between the two models of the Jetta GLI ? More importantly, how can I tell which version this one is ?  There are no badges that said ""16v"" so I am inclined to think that is the 8v version. Assuming this one (the one I looked at) is the 8v version, is there a valid reason to buy it instead of a comparably equipped GL which would cost less ? (Of course I would love to get the 16v version, but money talks.)  Please EMail any responses.  Thank you. Peter Volpe PV9955@albnyvms.bitnet","automotive"

I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I  ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice,  which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370  miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put  together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000  cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but  considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the  new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a  shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next  year (according to a WSJ article).   Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in  Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January  1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.

I loved this car, I babied it, I pampered it, and after 2 years, it just couldn't stay together, I would say that not everyone will have the problems that I had, but know this, it's not just the car, it is the ability to get the car fixed, which will NOT happen at any chrysler/dodge/take your pick dealer.  I don't care if there are going to reform their dealers/service with the intro of the LH cars, I will believe it when I see it.  Case and point, the local dodge dealer.  You drive up, just looking, you don't even get out of your door, when about 10 (yes 10) salesman all eye you like their next meal, and literally pounce on you, and try to get you to make a deal, on everything your eye wanders towards. Service is about 2 times worse than that.  I had an alignment problem, but they tried to tell me that the K frame was bent, and about 2000 dollars of work/parts to fix it.  Let me tell you the problems I had, and I took care of this car, I put alot of miles on it in the first couple years, but took it to every checkup it needed, and many that shouldn't have been.  1988 Dodge Shadow ES  These were replaced within the 4 years that I owned the car.  Engine  4 Alternators Rear Suspension Torsion Bar 2 Water pumps 5 thermostats Hall effect sensor Main computer 4 Batteries  These were rebuilt/repaired  Radiator Automatic Transmission Power Steering   Those are just the things I can remember off the top of my head.  For about a year before I sold the car, I said to myself, it's a good car, I just can't find anybody competent enough the fix it.  In the end, before I traded it in for a Saturn, the power steering started acting up again.  I just stopped putting money into it.  I must have put at least $5000-$7000 worth of repairs over it's lifetime.  I am sorry but Lee Iacocca can bite me.  Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart, and no one will buy them without assurance, why the hell do you think that LH has been nicknamed Last Hope.  You can do better, and I know people will disagree with me here, but Japanese, like Honda, or Toyota, or the only american car company that I feel is a quality product, Saturn.  I will not touch another chrysler product again, no way.  I don't care how good the LH cars look good, and I will admit they look promising, but not with the support that you get.  GM isn't much better, thank god, they don't control Saturn, like they do their divisions, or it would be just another marketing ploy.    Don't get me wrong, i will be watching my car (which I do like) like a hawk for the next 4 years.  I am much more hesitant to say it (or any) car is really good, until it has proved itself to me.  But since someone else pointed out C&D as a source.  I will note, because I used to read these magazines, that Car and Driver has never had a good thing to say about most Chrysler products (Shadow for one), always were they moaning about the reguritated K-car, and engine.  Whereas Motor Trend always thought they were great cars.  No car magazine is really objective.  And although there are alot of people who don't like Consumers Reports, I will use them to reinforce my argument (I already know about the big stink with the Saturn crash tests, time will tell how good a car they are), the shadow/sundance rate much worse than average, in fact none of the chrysler's rate a better than average, I think the best one is just average.  Excluding the diamond star/mitsubishi stuff and the LH's.  You can find bad stuff about the Shadow.  Try as I might, when I researched the Saturn, I could not find anything bad about it.  There is a great deal of information about this company, just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community, for good reason.  Much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company.  I read an article, which had a sub-column, an I think this imprinted on me more than anything else.  Some big wig in Toyota said and I quote, ""We are watching them very closely.""  Come on, everybody grow up, the foreign cars, especially the japanese have been kicking our butts, for good reason, the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days, to set in their ways, which is one of the reasons Saturn was created.  They are still struggling because they haven't learned yet.  They have the ability, the workers are not inferior, the technology is not out of date, but their attitude is, and they are just finding this out.  It's called competition gentleman/women if you don't satisfy the demand of the consumer, well your out..    *asbestos suit on*  Gaia ","automotive"

Drivess well, sounds good, body is OK, he wants $3000. i liked the car, despite it's auto tranny, but my wife will be a primary driver on this one, and she wants auto. The radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn (!) The A/C seems to have a leak.  The sunroof is sticky, but operational. Odometer does not work, as mentioned before. Idle is a bit bouncy, going from 900rpm to 1200rpm. Wipers are slow. That's teh gripes. The owner says that he changed radiator, alternator,  rotors and calipers, exhaust. The biggest problem, is that the owner is a shifty SOB, telling strange stories. I hate that. I would never buy from a persom like that, except, how often you see a descent 528i for that amount of money. He also said that, although I could bring a mechanicin, he wouldn't let me check the car by taking  it to a garage. Suspicious. And who knows what milage is on it. So, let me know what to check for, given there's practically no rust. I know there was an article on 528i in R&D a few years back, anybody remembers what issue? Mike.S","automotive"

Lines: 51 Nntp-Posting-Host: ssc.sas.upenn.edu  My 85 Caprice Classic with 120K+ miles has finally reached the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that I am forced to post :).  Anyone out there who might be able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below, please e-mail or post!  1. When making turns, especially when accelerating,    there is usually a loud ""thunk"" from the rear of    of the car.  Sounds like it could be the differential.    What could cause this?  Is the differential going    bad?  I recently had the differential fluid changed,    and it DID have tiny metal bits in it.  (And no,    the sound is NOT something rolling around in the    trunk!)    2. On starting the car, I get blue (oil) smoke from    the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  Exhaust valves    going bad?  Worn rings?  Anyone know whether the    valves on the 4.3 TBI engine can be lapped?  3. Brakes.  More pedal travel than I feel comfortable    with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is    relatively clear.  Pedal does NOT slowly sink to    the floor when held down.  Pedal does not feel    spongey, but I suppose that bleeding the brakes    might help -- could anything else cause this?  4. Tranny.  Tranny problems seem to be slowly getting    worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from    3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more    recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.    Fluid (checked with car running with tranny put    through all the gears and then back to park, as per    Haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.  5. My springs all around are just about shot -- I have    4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps    in turns at moderate to high speed.  How hard are    they to change?  Can they be reconditioned?  I'd be interested in hearing from any GM full-size RWD owners out there with stories to tell and/or advice.  Here in Philly, these cars are apparently stolen(!) quite often and converted into taxis.  Apparently the cab conversion shops will get a junk title for the car or switch VINs with a car about to be junked.  About 60% of Philly cabs are Caprice's, with most of the rest being Crown Vic's with a few old New Yorkers and Impalas (& Broughams). --  Andrew White awhite@mcneil.sas.upenn.edu","automotive"

I bought it in California, and if it'll let me, I'd like to keep it for another year.  The only problem is these Indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.  The car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  Right now it is stuck in the ""vent"" mode.  It will blow warm air, but I can't switch the air flow to either the floor (I can live without this) or the defrost (I can't  live without this).  I probably could just jam the air deflector to the  defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well, kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.  I have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down and outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in- side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.  Two questions:  	1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than 	the fact that I should move from Indiana) ?  	2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there 	a way to ""fix"" this?

Now, now, before we get too carried away here....  Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically, I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle. I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society, of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.          ","automotive"

But in case there are some misconceptions, I think Henry Robertson hasn't updated his data file on Korea since...mid 1970s.  Owning a car in Korea is no longer a luxury.  Most middle class people in Korea can afford a car and do have at least one car.  The problem in Korea, especially in Seoul, is that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is no place to park.  Last time I heard, back in January, the Kim Administration wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide his or her own parking area, just like they do in Japan.  	Also, Henry would be glad to know that Hyundai isn't the only car manufacturer in Korea.  Daewoo has always manufactured cars and I believe Kia is back in business as well.  Imported cars, such as Mercury Sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still quite expensive.  	Finally, please ignore Henry's posting about Korean politics and bureaucracy.  He's quite uninformed. --  T. H.

This concerns the clutch on a 92 Honda Accord 5 speed. When the clutch is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  Then the clutch shifts smoothly.  This chatter started when I moved to the San  Francisco Bay area from a low-humidity environment.  The dealer stated that this is known to happen since Honda changed from an asbestos to non-asbestos clutch material.  No remedy!!

I've wanted to own a 914 for about 10 years now; came close once but I ended up buying a Fiero instead (biggest mistake of my life!)  Anyway, for $4000 you should be able to get a nice car but your also set in the price range to get taken by a nice looker that is a pile of shit. The most common total failure for the car would be frame rust between the engine and passenger compartment.  Also look for chassis welded together here.  Oh yeah, the price range you are talking about must be the 4 banger; a 6 (if you could find one) would be mucho more bucks.  Parts for the engine are pretty easy to come by (for an old car) and you can even locate crude in the JC Whitney catalog if you have too.  The machine itself is pretty simple (they use the spare tire for windshild washer instead of a pump fer chris sake!) so getting it fixed by a good bug/porsche mechanic would be easy.  Since it is mid-engine you may spend more on labor for any mechanical work.  -- Jeff Miller                 Network Systems Corporation Internetwork Group          7600 Boone Avenue North jmiller@network.com         Minneapolis MN 55428   (612)424-4888 ","automotive"

The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires, front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts. The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks. Questions:  Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?  The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way of braking action?  It seemed to be ""doggy"" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?  The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever shrunk?  Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?  Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?  Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be appreciated.  Phil Truesdale truesdal@david.wheaton.edu ","automotive"

But why not turn the question around, why are automatics so common in the US?

Without further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:   1) Servotronic steering:  [For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and used in Audis and BMWs.]  I have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past couple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to report now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I suppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been loaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that I have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I'd be much happier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no longer consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is ruined.  The steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver's hands.  So there is feel and there is accuracy in the S4's steering.  But there is also room for improvement.  I consider the S4's steering to be better than the Japanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in ""feel"" and engineer it out completely.   2) Engine  Wheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did not expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific punch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there's only 2.2 liters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a fashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm redline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which translates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s. The technical achievement is breadthtaking.  Throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In fact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts are almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the ""overboost"" feature than to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features up to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the right foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a few moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go, maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb ft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite a heavy car, one's body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado VR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding 5 banger..  Yes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as serene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite up to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I'd say that in terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However, lost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined. The 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost.  Subjectively, I'd rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more musical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi's own V8 is also far more musical, with a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can match its grunt.  The only hint of the engine's true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra inertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall.  Alternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should offer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in extremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically, in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...   3) Chassis  I've noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16.. which is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke wheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth watering macho, yet subdued look.   On rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I digress.  To use a cliche, the S4's body feels like it has been carved out of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough roads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the S4's ride quality will never worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars.  The servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was able to test the car's cornering powers without too much trepidation. I think a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires, talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a banked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I went around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the limits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were thrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of story.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX's clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.  The brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too, though I've read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too surprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi 100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the luxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity.  The LS400's fade performance is nothing to brag about; neither is the Q45's or the Legend's.  Brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody's attention is focused on anti-lock capability.   4) Comfort  For a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also excellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the '92 S4.  All the expected gizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this and that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed because Audi hasn't gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the car has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance.    Unusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as well as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.  Noise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn't consider the Lexus' advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer.   5) Conclusion  Even though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price of $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if it doesn't produce Ferrari sounds.  No other luxury/sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive, which to some is worth the extra money all by itself.  The safety features are also  top notch.. 1994 side impact standard compliant, the very elegant  automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags.  The 100 series Audis have been outstanding in government crash tests.  It gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating.   eliot ","automotive"

For the information of those not ""lucky"" enough to live in the city of Austin, TX, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks, it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  This is an ordinance unique (I think) to the city of Austin.  Freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2X cost here. Recovered freon is not required to be ""purchased"" from the car it is withdrawn from.

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather - it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.  Jeff Goss","automotive"

Basically, limited tort means that you give up your right to sue for pain and suffering, unless one of the following conditions is met: 1. Your medical bills resulting from the accident exceed $X (where X is some number like 50,000 -- I'm not sure of the exact number)  2. The accident was caused by a drunk driver (I mean, the OTHER driver was drunk)  3. You get a good lawyer and have a good case (basically, you can appeal to regain your right to sue, but there's almost no chance of this ever happening).  You are only giving up your right to sue for pain and suffering; you can still sue for medical costs, actual damages, etc. By agreeing to limited tort, you are essentially giving up your right to be an asshole who treats every accident as an entry into the litigation lottery. In exchange, you get a substantial reduction in your rates. I save $150/year.  Unfortunately, the insurance companies have managed to scare and confuse people so much that only about 5% of Pennsylvanians go for limited tort. I guess that's OK -- If more people opted for it, the insurance companies would be pushing harder for repeal.","automotive"

Anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  The Bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.  If any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to design ""experimental"" safety cars, you will recognize the general appearance of the Bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  Anyone recall other safety features?  The engine was an american v-8, Ford I think is right.  Personally, I kinda like the way they look, and if I remember from the old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  The choice of colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly visible, I suppose.    The Delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (IMO) but no motor at all.

Keep the deal with the dealer simple by eliminating 2 & 3.  Buying a car at  ""dealer's cost"" is meaningless if he makes $1000 on the trade and/or gets a  kickback from the bank.  Blue book (you need to know if you're talking average wholesale or average  retail) is a good guide to value for a car.  If you are selling it yourself,  try to get average retail, and chances are you'll have done ok.

It sounds like your analysis is based on hypothesis and not actually using the Valentine-1.  I'd like to give some feedback based on real life experince.  I keep the Valentine-1 in advanced logic mode and it rarely lights up as a Christmas tree.  The only time it does is when I am in the middle of a major shopping area and then it makes sense that is does since there are >= 8 sources coming from many different directions.  I have found the Valentine-1 to be consistent in its reporting of bogeys regardless of any moving cars in the area.  I have found the directional indication to be very useful.  In one case there was two radar traps set up within one mile of each other.  As I passed the first radar trap, the direction indication changed.  Then the detector was set off again pointing in the forward direction.  With other radar detectors I would have assumed that this was due to a reflection. But with the Valentine-1 I knew there was a high probability that there was another trap.  And there was!  On other occasions, the directional helped discern a false alarm from a true alarm.  For example, as I pass a source, the direction indicator changes.  The directional also allows me to focus my attention as to where the signal might be coming from instead of having to look all over the  place.  When a car is approaching me from the rear with a detector that leaks, I can tell that the signal is coming from the rear and as the car passes me I can verify the source.  With other detectors, I would have been unable to do this and would have had to assume that there was a radar trap when there was none.  I've had the Valentine-1 for several months now and find its added features to be useful and not gimmicks.                                         -Barry --  -----                                                                   -------- Barry Frishberg                                             blf@apollo.ch.hp.com Chelmsford-UK Expert Center                                      508/TN 436-4319 Chelmsford, MA                                                 ","automotive"

The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission. Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless  I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound. The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say  this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT? And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK while attempting to put it in reverse:    1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.    2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is       fully depressed.    3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.    4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was       stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if       it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)    5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having        someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),       while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.    6- The shifter acted normally after that.  When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the  clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.  I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because  Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while they had the car.   In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage, and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to send someone to check the car while it was stuck.  I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting  from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get  the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems,  and with how to handle Mitsubishi.   All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to bore you with the long post.  Thanks, Rabih.","automotive"

It originally had a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based on the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear and a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was limited as a performer.  There has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other models.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that were also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer 1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon, and a ""sport coupe"", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there were two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900 engine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also available as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights, but was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.  In 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last year for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations and the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing to build the GTs.  The 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the Manta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with Bosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and wider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century low price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.  From 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by the Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them Opels instead of changing the dealers' neon signs.  Various models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the 70's in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.  Parts are still available from a number of sources.  (I still have a '73 manta and two '75 sedans and all the trick parts I could collect in 20 years). --  John Kennedy                     uunet!opel!johnk Second Source, Inc.              johnk@secondsource.COM  Annapolis, MD","automotive"

If a manual transmission is a ""must have"", then the M-B 300TE is not in the running.  You cannot get a manual transmission in that car in North America.  It seems that buyers here (or, maybe more accurately, the distributors) are not interested in manual trannies.  The '93 300 line comes with a 217 hp engine.  All earlier years are 177 hp. I have an '87 300E, with a ""mere"" 177 hp and auto tranny, and I find that it has sufficient power for any normal driving situation.  More is always nice, but I can't complain.  I test drove a Saab 900 CSE last fall.  Here are my impressions:  1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on. 2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel    drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously ""hook"" into    the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful    front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it    does not have this problem.) 3) Huge interior and cargo space. 4) The most ""rubbery"" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It    was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don't know.    I also didn't like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.    From the shifter's position, I got the impression that Saab really designed    the car for an automatic. 5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does    not exhibit these characteristics.)  You should also check out the new BMW 525 ""touring"".  This is a wagon version of the 525i.  It fits into the class with the 300TE and Saabs.  -- Michael Chmilar chmilar@apple.com","automotive"

Traditional wisdom says you are almost certainly better off selling it  yourself if you don't mind that extra hassle.  Having a trade-in on a purchase just makes getting the best price from a dealership more confusing.  >i know that the ""blue book"" value for the car is $2825.  I assume this is _retail_ bluebook.  There are two bluebook prices, one for retail and one for wholesale.  You really want the retail price if you can  get it.  The blue books also have adjustments you can make for low mileage and extras on your particular car.  You should look all this stuff up yourself. Also keep in mind that the blue book prices are averages over the country that may not apply in your area.  For example, blue book prices are low for California.  A better way of finding out how much your car might be worth is to call around and see what it's selling for (if any used lots have one) or looking in local papers for similar cars and checking out the prices.  It  might be more time efficient to take a small loss (rather than hold out for 6 months for the best price).  >an acquaintence >has offered to give me blue book value for the car.  I don't know what you mean by ""an acquaintance"" but I would make darn sure that I was paid, that is, cashier's check in full before delivery.  There's a real temptation when selling to a pseudo-friend to be more accomodating than you should.  Make sure you get the money and if they hedge about paying in full at the start (with a cashier's check or cash) then I would go elsewhere.  Rememeber that you can probably sell your car to a used car lot or wholesaler and get wholesale bluebook.

The Cd is related to the drag force which is what effects top speed and fuel consumption. When the drag force on the car or aircraft is greater than what the vehicle's engine can overcome it has reached its top speed. (autos of course also have to overcome rolling resistance) Since drag opposes the vehicle's motion, the engine must make up for that by burning more fuel. Anyway, since the geometery of an auto is rather complex, the Drag,pressure coeffiecent,etc is either found experimentaly, or using a numerical method.  anyway for flow around a cylinder the drag coeff is:              Cd = d/(q*2R)         where d is the drag force, q the flow velocity and R is the radius of the clyinder.    To get a rough (very rough) estimate, you can set R at 1/2 the car's width, q at the car's speed and knowing the Cd, find the drag force that the car would need to overcome.         -Bp","automotive"

Also, VW uses a kind of turbocharger on their Jetta ECOdiesel that helps reduce particulates as well, although I don't know the mechanics of it.  Many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in Europe are now being equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.  It's a shame GM had to soil the diesel's reputation in passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even further ahead of gas engines in emissions.  erik","automotive"

Mahan) says:  >Could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e Cd) mentioned in magazines.  I understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but >what does this mean in the real world.  Is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the Cd reduced from .34 to .33.  It's pretty complex, and Cd isn't the whole story either.  Cd for cars is usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  So a large car with a good Cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a poorer Cd.   To calculate drag use this formula:  D = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * Cd * S  Where D is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3), V is the velocity (ft/s), and S is the frontal area (ft^2).  Note that the pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force).   Note that power is:  P = F * v  Where P is power (lbf-ft/s), F is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v is velocity (ft/s).   Note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting D for force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  That's why huge increases in power result in little increases in speed.  Ditto for decreases in Cd.   So if you have a 100 mph car and reduce Cd from .34 to .33, your new top speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)  101 mph  Sorry to dissappoint.   --  Al Bowers  DOD #900  Alfa  Ducati  Hobie  Kottke  'blad  Iaido  NASA ""Well goodness sakes...don't you know that girls can't play guitar?""                                              -Mary Chapin-Carpenter","automotive"

Shaz,  Hmm.. but the service indicators that I have works this way:   There are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start   your car. The computer will actually ""sense"" how you drive your car and   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go   on. And you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.      After service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the   computer starts counting again.

It's the first european car I have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a  surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-).

While I  never intentionally slamed my '68 Firebird 400 ci Conv. into gear, I would leave  the trannie in Low (read 1st), grab hold, hit the pedal, and once the tires  grabbed, take off.  When I reached about 57-60mph the turbo 400 Auto would  shift to S (read 'super' or 2nd) and leave about 10 to 15 foot of double  stripped rubber on the ground.  Most everyone I knew at the time was quite  impressed with 'peeling' out at 60 MPH.  The trannie held up just fine. Motor mounts would last about a year until I tied the motor down with large chains.

I believe that automatics should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise would not be able to drive.  Automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy. More time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery instead of concentrating on the road.  The manual transmission keeps the drive always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  Plus, driving should be FUN!  Driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore. 	In the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster that any human could move a stick.  If I was racing, I'd want and automatic.

Bullshit, whoever backs em best, is just afraid the stupid things area 	The part about spending $5000-7000 on repairs reminds me of an article I read in a magazine comparing the 5 year ownership costs of a Toyota Camry and a Ford Taurus or something like that.  The result, which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period.  That was their argument to prove that you don't go wrong buying the Ford Taurus over the Camry.  	Now, if I remember correctly, the Camry costs about $4000 or so more in initial costs.  Essentially, it means that you spend about $4000 extra on repairs on the Taurus.  That is ridiculous.  Every time your car needs repairs, it is extra hassles, loss of time and a dozen other things. I would much rather spend $5000 more in initial costs than spend $4000 more in repair costs.  -- ----------------->8      Cut here for Signature!       8<--------------------- Balaji Ramanathan,                   |  Institute of Transportation Studies, |         I don't believe in luck!

The shock sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have on my other car.

Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's cause and it was not a false alarm. >  > I'm also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl > underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm. >  I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.  > Viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that > supposedly detects people approcahing the car.... >  This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter. I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on.  Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back.  The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind. >  > I'm interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems > and about the viper in general. >  I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the alarm is armed/disarmed.    I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest. > The car is an 89 Ford Probe GT that used to be in great shape! >  >  > Ron Garnett >   I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor.  The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle) than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is.  Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only.  Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>   Merrill ","automotive"

Gas is much more expensive, so people are very concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  This, along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with smaller engines.  These engines usually don't have the torque to mesh well with an automatic.  So, having engines that don't work well with autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual Euro-car has a manual.  (Note that not many big Benzes come with manuals.  If you've got the money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to drive through the slushbox.)  As automatics become more efficient, the ""bigotry"" is probably reduced.  Still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  So there aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.  -dB  -- ","automotive"

I had a '82 Saab 900 Turbo, and now have a '87 BMW 325is  There is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of engineering. The BMW wins hands down. After 5 years I was sick and tired of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the SAAB. The 6-year old BMW is still as sweet as it was new.  But I see you are posting from western MA. BMW's **SUCK** in the snow. I have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and I still try to avoid driving in the snow. I happily took the SAAB through blizzard conditions without a worry. I would say this is the single design flaw in the BMW.   --  Jonathan Edwards				edwards@intranet.com IntraNet, Inc					617-527-7020","automotive"

I see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers? Where did you learn logic?  As for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) Celica GTS seats due to my back problem. That is why I had to reuse the MR2 brackets and that's why the MR2 seats I sell are attached to Celica brackets.  Please in the future think before you make allegations like the above. It hurts.

As far as I've heard, unless the owner is _very_ hard up, the GT-40s are not for sale at any price that mere mortals could afford.  >And maybe the Mustang >will be forever King of the Road, the GT-40 isn't road legal.  I think the GT-40 actually _is_ street legal, although that particular question is moot (see the price figures below).  >This car was right hand drive (weren't they all like that?). How much does >a GT-40 go for? How many were made?  I wish I could find my Shelby-American guide; it included the GT-40 registry (as of '88 or so). There were precious few of them made  (fifty is the number that springs to mind; they made just enough to qualify for the Manufacturer's Cup, or whichever series it was that Shelby broke Ferarri's 13-year winning streak in in '65), and they are all accounted for. The last price I saw estimated on a GT-40 was a little bit over $1,000,000 (yes, that's right, ONE MILLION US DOLLARS; it was second only to some worthless piece of Ferrari that it would blow the doors off of ;-).  I don't recall off-hand what the drive configuration was, although I'm certain some must have been LHD, as they had to be sold to qualify for racing. The drivertrain was the Ford 427 (hi-riser, I think,  and/or side-oiler) coupled to various 4-speed transmissions. They also used 3-speed manuals; they had lots of problems with the original trannys breaking under the load of the 427. Layout was rear-engine, rear-drive, with the ""bundle of snakes"" exhaust headers...I can remeber other bits and pieces of info, but I can't remember whether they applied to the GT-40 or the Shelby Cobra Daytona Coupe...I'll try and find that reference.

Driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt & dust.  Needs attention to brake cylinders (like all MG-T's) but otherwise ready to run.  Chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent. The engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  It is priced at $12,000.  1953 MG-TD Good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  Needs engine work, but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.  1952 MG-TD Basket Case.  I'd call it a parts car, but it's too good for that.  Everything seems to be there except the tach.  Would make a good project car or parts car if you insist.  No apparent rust but the upholstery is a disaster.  Stored inside since the '70's.  The top was new but now soso.  This one has wire wheels!  Looking for $4,500.

I bought a brand new 1992 Chevrolet K2500 HD 4x4 extended cab last May.  It has had many, many problems.  See my earler post that describes the situation.  I went to BBB arbitration, and they ruled that Chevrolet must buy it back from me.  If you do get one, stay away from the 5 speed manual with the deep low first gear.  They have put three of them in my truck so far.  After about 1,500 miles, overdrive either starts rattling or hissing loudly.  There is no way to fix them.  Chevrolet  says that the noise is ""a characteristic of the transmission.""  Also, if you are planning to use your truck to tow, the gear ratios in that tranny suck.  On a steep hill, you get up to about 55 MPH in second gear at 4,000 RPM (yellow line).  If you shift to third, the RPM drop to only 2,500, and you begin to loose speed.  I should point out that the 350 V8 they put in the HD (8600 GVW) trucks is a detuned motor compared to the one they put in the light duty ones.  They dropped the compression ratio, supposedly for ""engine longevity"" reasons.  So the light duty 350 may pull better than my truck does. Other things that have gone wrong include the ventilation fan (3 times  so far), paint (had specs of rust embedded in the paint from being shipped by rail with no covering), and suspension parts (link between stabilizer and control arm fell off).  Any company can make a bad individual car, Chevrolet included.  What really bothered me was the way they reacted.  They made no attempt to deal with me except to tell me to take it back to the dealer for  them to attempt to fix it one more time.  So I bought a brand new Ford F250 HD Super Cab with a 460 and an automatic.  I will never buy another Chevrolet.  jackw@hpdmd48.boi.hp.com","automotive"

It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try di it yourself.  You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset. Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you.  Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every 15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car.  I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil, air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils and done almost all of the other things req for service 1 and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights. After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.  Good luck!

(I'm >not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began >production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)  	Ahh Broncos.  Well personally, I have a '78.  The blue book is just a hair over 3 grand.  I bought it for 2500 and then bought new tires 650 front end rebuild 350, carb rebuild 130.  Then i did the unthinkable and blew the engine (not bronco specific, unmaintained engine with 168,000) 2400 more bucks there, now it is in nice condition, well after new seats out of a t-bird, radio, 2 amps, speakers, alarm, well the radio and amps were  free and i bought the speakers used for 40 bucks, and the other speakers i took out of my old jeep (Sell a Jeep for a bronco you might ask, but it was a Wagoneer).  Its a lovely specimen, solid front and rear axels, ford 9"" and a dana 44 up front.  Watch the rear axel wrap, i  busted off my u-bolts ONCE, i added traction shocks after that and  haven't had a problem since.  Also the bottom of the doors tend to  rot, bottom of the tailgates likes to rust right up to the new ones that might be in your budget.  The post 80 broncos have that sickly TTB front end and little stamped and folded steel radius arms were as the 78-79 have nice big cast iron longer radius arms(ie more prspective wheel travel).  The only rust i have is on my doors and a few dings in the sheet metal.  I don't know when the removeable tops were discontinued but they are fun.  I just ordered a full convertable top for 400$ for mine(credit card).  Don't ever break the window if you have the double laminated bronzed privacy glass in your cap it is over 400 bucks to replace.  My bronco also does pretty good offroad, i haven't bottomed out my suspension, YET, and have crossed over 3 foot deep of water with no problems, handles rocks like a charm too. One problem is it is WIDE and you sometimes can't follow a CJ or a Toyota, between two rocks or trees, and your grandmother will have a hard time getting up into it.  BOB","automotive"

Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still  	too small.  Ford Explorer:  	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader. 	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the 	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would 	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and 	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like, 	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get 	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10"" shorter 	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual  	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying.    	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it? 	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories?

""Dealer invoice"" is *not* ""dealer cost"". You'll hear lots of ads screaming ""two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"" Sounds like a real deal, huh?  No.  You know what the ""dealer invoice"" (also called factory invoice) is?  It's a piece of paper with numbers on it that the factory sends the dealer.  What do the numbers signify?  Absolutely nothing.  It's a marketing gimmick that the salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  Note that nowhere on the ""invoice"" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast, low voice saying something like ""invoice may not reflect actual dealer cost"".  Actually, I *guarantee* it does not reflect actual dealer cost.  Also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent. Adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that you want.  Haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of ""dealer prep"" and ""protection package"" (i.e. a few squirts of paint and fabric protectant).  While you're at it, ask the salesman to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.

One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this one, too).

I have recently purchased (within the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.    Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors was touted as covering.    So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the new Super Ka wideband.    Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my ""new"" detector? Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be  worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the  market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar  bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business. > >                                  \|/ >                                ####### >                              / ~     ~ \ >                              |[0]---[0] | >   ===============================| |=================================== >  _|___                           |_|        		    	    ___|_ > (_____) Allen Tobias           Technical    email:                (_____) > (_____) Convex Computer Corp.

The other  breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were Mk IVs). The LHD/RHD breakdown is only given on the Mk IIIs.  The prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 Million mark, last I heard, with a projection of some $3.5 Million (or thereabouts) in 2000. It was second only to some penny-ante Ferarri ;-).  Shelby won the FIA World Manufacturer's Cup with his Cobras in '65; that was also the year that he retired them from the Shelby-American racing team (in favor of the Ford GT program the next year). That victory broke a 13(?) year Ferarri winning streak.  Well, there's lotsa info I could spout, but I'll refrain.

All of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on.  ALso it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know BMW's are not cheap to fix either.  The owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone. Sure $ 3000 sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be. It sounds like you would have to sink in at least $ 1000 to get everything fixed if not more. Also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned. Who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven.  Sure people tell you BMW's hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear. For all you know it could have 200,000 miles on it.  The thing you have to remember is that this isn't the last 528i around either. Just wait and keep shopping. For around $ 5000-6000 you can probably find one that is better, needs less repair, and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering. Take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times. Good luck. Al Himsl","automotive"

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break.

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.  Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the ""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet  accessible--with room for performance tweaking.  The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche, and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least, does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration. In the case of the Viper, yes, we are discussing a HUGE multicylinder 90-deg. engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  And my understanding, btw, is that that V-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad- aptible for either the trucks or the Viper.  And from what I've heard (no first hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.  And the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree DOHC Colombo-designed V-12.  Period.  Michael T.

I can't tell if Matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment) than the people that would take them.  I don't have figures on average property tax in the U.S. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior public schools, jails, or the like, but I have a feeling that the amount the government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is  significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  And for those who will argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to mention committing COMPLETELY senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, I submit that they are not human beings.  Jim Callison, I think, is on the right track.  And  Chintan Amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions of a single criminal.  I couldn't agree more.  One could trace any crime back to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out, from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't their fault?

Again, this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you should shoot someone for property damage/vandalism/theft, but every responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits, and the punishment must fit the crime.

I recently bought a 2 band detector.  You guys must all think I'm nuts, right?  Well, I did a little research into Ka usage in this area and found out that Ka is not currently being used in this state as well as surrounding states.  Here's how I found out:  - A cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know    what Ka is.  He's heard of K, which is what they use here and I   explained that Ka is used for photo radar etc.. He then said, yeah,   ""Ka stands for K automatic""... duuhh.  He then went on to say that   plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high   tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.  - My 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,   even the real sneaky ones.  - When I called the Escort Shop, they confirmed that Ka is not used here   or in surrounding states.  They did claim that Laser was being used   a lot here, which I was quite skeptical of.  So in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting months for a state of the art detector, I got a low priced, high performance 2 band Escort 2200.  Incidentally its performance is equal to their top of the line model in X and K band detection.  I know that Escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but I've never fully relied on a detector and I was convinced that the Escorts would be at least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.   eliot","automotive"

The actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer   probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory    kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume   at the end of the month/quarter/whatever.

The colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so  apparent.  The better approach is to buff minor scratches completely off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.
