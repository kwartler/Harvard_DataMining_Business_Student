"Chewbacca","Main Biography An immense, fur covered warrior of great strength and loyalty, Chewbacca the Wookiee was a well-known figure in both the underworld and in the Rebel Alliance. Born on Kashyyyk over two centuries before the Battle of Yavin, Chewbacca was a wise, sophisticated being with exceptional skills in starship piloting and repair. Chewbacca is a veteran of the Clone Wars, the galaxy-wide conflict that pitted the clone armies of the Republic against the droid forces of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Wookiee was part of the high command tasked with protecting Kashyyyk from droid invasion. There, he served with fellow Wookiee Tarfful and the Jedi Master Yoda.The wise Yoda had maintained a good relationship with the denizens of Kashyyyk, earning the respect of the mighty Wookiees. When events surrounding the rise of the Empire resulted in the clone forces betraying their Jedi generals, Chewbacca and Tarfful remained loyal to Yoda, helping the Jedi Master escape the clone trap.For their brutish strength and technological savvy, Wookiees were enslaved by the Empire for use as labor. For a time, Chewbacca was a slave, toiling away for the betterment of the Empire until an impudent Imperial cadet named Han Solo freed him.Drummed out of the military, Solo had few options but to return to the fringe lifestyle he knew so well. Chewbacca swore loyalty to Han, and became his partner in crime. The two of them became a well-known smuggling duo. When they came into ownership of the freighter Millennium Falcon, their exploits became legendary.Chewbacca and Solo spent hours modifying and tinkering on their beloved Falcon, souping it up far beyond its original performance specs. Although the Falcon's upkeep was a labor of love, many a time Chewie unleashed his legendary temper on the recalcitrant freighter, banging his massive furry hands against delicate components that refused to behave.Chewbacca became Solo's conscience of sorts. Though the smuggler maintained a mercenary air of bravado that refused to adhere to any ideals other than self-preservation, Chewie was openly the more compassionate of the two. Perhaps it was the ordeal suffered by his people at the hands of the Empire that caused Chewie to feel this way. Although Solo steered clear of any allegiance during the Galactic Civil War, Chewbacca definitely supported the Rebel cause, though the two of them tried to avoid the struggle altogether.Ironically, a simple steerage assignment landed them in the heart of the Rebel Alliance. Desperate for cash, Chewie and Han took on a charter of two passengers and their droids from Tatooine to Alderaan. Little did the two smugglers realize that their cargo consisted of a legendary Jedi Knight, the son of the prophesied Chosen One in Jedi mythology, and a pair of droids containing information vital to both the Empire and the Alliance. This trip inextricably drew Chewbacca and Solo into the Rebel fold, and they continued flying missions for the Rebellion for years after that.Chewbacca stood 2,28 meters tall and had a coat of ginger-brown fur. He wore nothing, save for a bandoleer that held specialized ammunition for the bowcaster that he carried, and a simple tool pouch so that he could enact the many repairs the chronically malfunctioning Falcon required.Additional History Unlike most Wookiees who rarely stray from the lush forests of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca's youthful wanderlust took him far from the confines of his green homeworld. His travels first included many remote and dangerous locales on Kashyyyk before taking him to the stars. Chewbacca's heart, however, was firmly rooted on Kashyyyk, and he would always try to make it home for important Wookiee holidays to share with his family. Following the Clone Wars, the Empire subjugated the planet -- ostensibly to punish the world for harboring Jedi fugitives, but mostly to exploit the Wookiees as slave labor. Chewbacca escaped capture for a time, helping his people as best as he could while living the life of a fugitive.Early on in their smuggling career, Chewbacca stunned Han Solo by returning to Kashyyyk to marry a female Wookiee named Mallatobuck. Solo never pegged Chewie as a family man, but Wookiee customs allowed Chewbacca to continue his flying with Han -- protecting him as the Wookiee life debt demanded -- while still being a husband and, eventually, father. Chewbacca's son, Lumpawarrump, was raised mainly by Malla and Chewie's father, Attichitcuk. Chewie continued to fly the spacelanes, avoiding Imperial patrols and smuggling contraband for various clients, but he returned often to Kashyyyk, to celebrate the Wookiee holiday of Life Day.Wookiees define family differently than most species. To a Wookiee, an ""honor family"" contains the closest of friends, and Chewbacca swore loyalty to all of them, offering protection even at great personal risk. When Han Solo and Leia Organa married and began to raise their own family, Chewbacca took their children into his honor family, and helped guard and raise the three young Solos -- Jacen, Jaina and Anakin.When Chewbacca learned that Solo had been captured by the bloodthirsty Yevetha during the Black Fleet Crisis, he disobeyed Leia's orders and flew straight into the heart of enemy territory: the Koornacht cluster. With the help of his cousins Jowdrrl, Dryanta, and Shoran, and his son, Lumpawarrump, he rescued Han from Yevethan clutches.At the start of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion, Han Solo and Chewbacca were on the planet of Sernpidal when it became a target of the alien menace. Using massive gravity-altering creatures called dovin basals, the Yuuzhan Vong began to drag Sernpidal's moon of Dobido from its orbit to the planet's surface. Han Solo, his teenaged son Anakin, and Chewbacca began organizing a desperate evacuation, cramming as many escapees aboard the Falcon as they could.Solo and Chewbacca have had many close calls in the past, and have executed countless last-second escapes; Sernpidal was not to be one of them. As the moon rushed closer to the surface, Chewbacca was cut off from the Falcon. Anakin was faced with a terrible decision. The Falcon could not wait any longer. Rather than endanger everyone aboard, Anakin piloted the ship away, leaving Chewbacca behind. Chewbacca stood his ground, howling defiantly at the immense moon as it crashed into Sernpidal's surface, killing the mighty Wookiee.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4NzgwMTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgzMTY2Mw@@._V1_.jpg"
"Han Solo","A New Hope At the beginning of A New Hope, Solo and Chewbacca are notorious smugglers. However, during one Kessel Run, the Imperial Navy intercepts and boards their ship, forcing Solo to jettison his cargo to avoid arrest. This results in a large and mounting debt to his former employer, Jabba the Hutt, who places a bounty on Solo's capture. Desperate to pay off his debt to Jabba, Solo accepts a charter to transport Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, and their two droids to the planet Alderaan. As a result, Solo reluctantly becomes involved in the Rebel Alliance and helps them rescue Princess Leia from Imperial custody, though he claims he is ""only in it for the money,"" and parts ways with the rebels after delivering them to safety and receiving his payment. However, near the end, he has a change of heart, and helps Luke Skywalker destroy the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin. As a result, Solo is handsomely rewarded and given, along with Luke Skywalker, the Alderaanian Medal of Freedom. The Empire Strikes Back In The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Solo again attempts to leave the Rebel Alliance as he is still being relentlessly pursued by Jabba's minions. However, he is once again dragged back into action when he saves Skywalker from freezing to death and Princess Leia from an Imperial invasion of the rebel base on Hoth. It is likely that Solo's personal feelings toward the princess played a major role in his decision. He takes her to hide on the planet Bespin, but his old friend Lando Calrissian betrays him and turns them over to Darth Vader, who was informed of their location by Solo's nemesis, bounty hunter Boba Fett. After being tortured by Vader, Solo's body is frozen in carbonite and given to Fett as a reward, who then delivers the incapacitated Solo to Jabba. Return of the Jedi Six months later, during the events of Return of the Jedi, Skywalker, now a nearly full-fledged Jedi, rescues Solo from Jabba (with help from Leia, Chewbacca, and a penitent Calrissian). Upon rejoining the rebels, Solo, now promoted to general, accepts their offer to lead the commando raid on an Imperial shield generator facility on the forest moon of Endor. By destroying the shield generator, they allow rebel fighters to enter the Death Star's superstructure and destroy it in the ensuing Battle of Endor, permanently crippling the Empire. The Force Awakens In the years since Return of the Jedi, Han has lost possession of the Millenium Falcon and gone back to smuggling with Chewbacca. He enters the plot when he and Chewbacca spot the stolen Falcon, which has been commandeered by Rey and Finn, in possession of the droid BB-8. The droid is carrying a star map leading to the location of Han's old friend, Luke Skywalker, who has gone into exile. Luke had been training a Jedi apprentice who later turned to the Dark Side, becoming Kylo Ren of the First Order, successor to the Empire. In grief and guilt, Luke had gone into hiding. We later learn that Kylo Ren is (spoiler) actually Ben Solo, the son of Han and Princess Leia.Han takes Rey and Finn to Tokodana, where he hopes his old friend Maz Kenada can guide his passengers to the Resistance so they can deliver BB-8 to Leia, whom Han hasn't seen in years. Spies in Maz's watering hole alert both the Resistance and the First Order to their presence, so both sides end up coming to them. The First Order attacks, and is successful in kidnapping Rey. The First Order fends off the attack, and Han is reunited with Leia. The former couple had drifted apart (spoiler) in grief over their son's turn to the Dark Side.Finn provides vital information about the First Order's new weapon, Starkiller Base, which can destroy entire solar systems. The base must be destroyed before the Resistance can complete their search for Skywalker. Finn volunteers to deactivate the shields from the inside, and Han agrees to take him there. The mission has additional meaning for both men: Finn is determined to rescue his new friend Rey, while Han has been tasked by Leia with (spoiler) bringing their son back home. Rey is ultimately able to free herself and reunite with Han and Finn. They deactivate the shields, but that is not enough, so they plant explosive devices throughout the station to make it easier for the Resistance to destroy.Kylo Ren senses their presence and seeks them out. [Spoiler]Seeing his opportunity, Han confronts Kylo, asking him to return to the Resistance base with him. Kylo says that he is torn between his love for his family and his loyalty to his master, Supreme Leader Snoke. He asks for Han's help to free him from his pain. Han, ever the loving father, agrees. Kylo Ren stabs his father through the heart with his lightsaber to complete his turn to the Dark Side./Spoiler]","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjY5MTAwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjAyMTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg"
"FN-2199","FN-2199, a.k.a. TR-8R, is the First Order Stormtrooper who served on a squad with Finn (then FN-2187) in the First Order. Upon seeing Finn during the attack on Mazs Castle, he calls him a traitor and he brandishes his riot control Z6 baton, Finn then ignites a lightsaber that once belonged to Luke Skywalker and they fight.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BM2EwYzUxN2ItN2YwZi00MmMxLTg2NWQtMDdlODUyNmQyZDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA5ODU0NDg@._V1_.jpg"
"Obi-Wan Kenobi","Obi-Wan Kenobi is a Jedi Knight, and a major character in the Star Wars saga. He is one of only four characters; the others being Anakin Skywaker, C-3PO and R2-D2; who appears in all six films. Obi-Wan acts as a mentor to Anakin Skywalker and his son Luke Skywalker. Prequel trilogy  The Phantom Menace In The Phantom Menace, 25-year-old Obi-Wan accompanies Qui-Gon on a mission to Naboo, a planet ruled by Queen Padmé Amidala. After making an unscheduled landing on Tatooine, his master stumbles upon Anakin Skywalker, a young slave who shows tremendous potential with the Force. Believing the boy to be the prophesied ""Chosen One"" who would bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith, Qui-Gon asks the Jedi Council that the boy to be trained as a Jedi. Obi-Wan is also amazed by Anakin's unprecedented midi-chlorian count and strong Force potential, but initially thinks he should not be trained, believing the boy is already too old and has too many emotional attachments to become a Jedi. The Jedi Council agrees, and forbids training for Anakin, in whom they see a great deal of fear and anger.During the film's climactic battle scene, Queen Amidala and her entourage of guards split up from her Jedi bodyguards when the Sith Lord Darth Maul arrives to eliminate the Queen. Wielding a double-bladed lightsaber, Maul simultaneously battles both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. After being separated from the duel via laser walls, Obi-Wan watches in horror as Maul impales his master. Obi-Wan engages Maul in a fierce duel, cutting Maul's lightsaber in half, but the Sith Lord knocks Obi-Wan into a reactor chasm and kicks his lightsaber into the depths below. Obi-Wan grabs onto an extending pole, breaking his fall. He then calms himself and reconnects with the Force, utilizing it to hurl himself into the air and simultaneously bring his master's lightsaber into his hand, startling Maul and giving him just enough time to slash the Sith Lord in half. The dying Qui-Gon tells Obi-Wan to train Anakin to be a Jedi, and Obi-Wan promises that he will.For his heroics in defeating a Sith (making him the first Jedi in 1,000 years to do so), Yoda personally bestows the rank of Jedi Knight upon Obi-Wan, who then says that he would take it upon himself to train Anakin whether the Council allowed him to or not. Yoda reluctantly agrees, but warns Obi-Wan to be careful with the troubled boy. Attack of the Clones In Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Obi-Wan has become an experienced Jedi Knight. By this time, his relationship with his padawan is strained; Anakin has grown powerful but arrogant, and believes that his Master is trying to hold him back.He and Anakin are tasked with protecting Padmé, now a Senator, after an attempt is made on her life. Obi-Wan tracks the mysterious assassin to the planet Kamino, and learns about a massive clone army that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Galactic Republic. He then meets with the bounty hunter Jango Fett, the template for the clones, and figures out that he is the one responsible for the assassination attempts on Padmé. Obi-Wan attempts to apprehend Fett, who escapes to Geonosis with his unaltered clone Boba. Obi-Wan follows them by placing a homing beacon on Fett's ship, Slave I.On Geonosis, Obi-Wan learns of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, also known as the Separatists, a conspiracy of star systems that wants to secede from the Republic. The renegades are led by rogue Jedi Count Dooku, who was once Qui-Gon's master. Obi-Wan is captured shortly after sending a message to Anakin. While in captivity, Dooku reveals that the Galactic Senate is under the control of a Sith Lord called Darth Sidious.Later, Anakin and Padmé arrive on Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan. They are themselves captured, however, and all three are sentenced to death by the Geonosians. The executions are prevented by the timely arrival of Jedi and clone reinforcements, led by Jedi Masters Mace Windu and Yoda. Obi-Wan and Anakin confront Dooku and engage him in a lightsaber duel. Dooku strikes Anakin with Force lightning, then turns the deadly barrage onto Obi-Wan, who easily blocks the attack with his lightsaber. The two duel and Dooku outmaneuvers Obi-Wan, striking him on both his left arm and leg. Dooku is about to deliver a killing blow when Anakin recovers from the lightning and blocks Dooku's attack. Dooku and Anakin fight a short duel, and Dooku cuts off Anakin's right arm (which is later replaced by a robotic prosthetic). Yoda arrives and fights Dooku as well, but the Sith escapes; he creates a distraction by nearly killing Obi-Wan and Anakin. Revenge of the Sith In Revenge of the Sith, set three years later, Obi-Wan and Anakin board the Separatist leader General Grievous' flagship, the Invisible Hand, and fight their way to the captive Chancellor Palpatine. There, they find Dooku, who engages them both in a duel. During the duel, Obi-Wan is rendered unconscious, leaving Anakin to face Dooku alone. Anakin defeats Dooku and, at Palpatine's urging, executes the defenseless Count, in violation of the Jedi Code.When Palpatine appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his representative, the Council disapproves, considering Anakin too young and headstrong, and reasons that his membership gives the Chancellor a vote in Jedi affairs. Anakin protests when the Jedi Council denies him the rank of Master and orders him to spy on Palpatine, but Obi-Wan talks him into accepting it, warning Anakin of his ""dangerous"" friendship with the Chancellor.Obi-Wan is called away to Utapau to confront General Grievous. This leaves Palpatine, (spoiler) who is secretly Darth Sidious, free to continue corrupting Anakin. The Sith Lord eventually manipulates the young Jedi into embracing the dark side as the Sith Lord Darth Vader.Obi-Wan engages Grievous in combat and shoots and kills him with a blaster. Moments later, however, Obi-Wan's own clone forces turn on him; Unbeknown to Obi-Wan, Palpatine had issued Order 66, directing clone troopers to turn on their Jedi generals. Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes by stealing Grievous' star fighter and rendezvousing with Senator Bail Organa and Yoda aboard Bail's ship, the Tantive IV.Along with Yoda and Bail, Obi-Wan returns to Coruscant, where he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the Jedi Temple has been murdered, even the younglings. They kill the clones remaining at the Temple, and discover that the clones were led there by Anakin. Obi-Wan reprogrammes a beacon, which had been instructing all remaining Jedi to return to the Jedi Temple (where they surely would be killed), by instructing them to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding. Subsequently, Obi-Wan and Yoda split up to confront the two Sith Lords, Darth Vader and Darth Sidious. Obi-Wan wishes to fight Sidious, hating the thought of having to kill his friend and pupil. Yoda, however, insists that Obi-Wan telling him ""to fight this Lord Sidious strong enough you are not"", and that he will have to accept that Anakin had been ""consumed by Darth Vader.""Unaware of his former Padawan's location, Obi-Wan goes to visit Padmé, who secretly married Anakin and is now pregnant with his child. He tells her what Anakin has done, and reveals that he knows about their marriage. A horrified Padmé refuses to accept what Obi-Wan tells her, but is brave enough to go out and confront Anakin herself. Obi-Wan stows away in her ship.Obi-Wan finds Vader at the volcanic planet Mustafar, and attempts to reason with his former student to pull him away from the dark side. When he emerges from Padmé's ship, however, Vader immediately suspects that Padmé has betrayed him, and uses the dark side to force choke her into unconsciousness. Obi-Wan has no choice but to engage him in a long and epic duel, which ranges through the Mustafar mining complex, the lava rivers, and finally the black sand. Obi-Wan tries to persuade Vader to relent, but Vader ignores his warnings and leaps forward to deliver the killing blow. Obi-Wan sees an opening and severs Vader's legs and remaining arm with one stroke. Obi-Wan refuses to finish him off however, and leaves him burning on the volcanic slopes, taking Anakin's lightsaber with him. Vader then slides too close to the lava and nearly burns to death. He survives long enough to be rescued by Palpatine, and is later placed in the iconic black body armor first seen in ""Revenge of the Sith"" and the rest of the original triology.Obi-Wan assists in hiding Anakin's children after Padmé dies in childbirth. Luke is put on Tatooine with Owen Lars, so that Obi-Wan can look after him in secret, while his twin sister Leia is put on Alderaan in Bail's care. Yoda then tells Obi-Wan that he has more training for him: the spirit of Qui-Gon would teach him how to retain his identity through the Force and commune with the living after death. Original trilogy A New Hope In A New Hope, Obi-Wan is known to the inhabitants of Tatooine as Ben Kenobi, an eccentric hermit who lives in the Jundland Wastes (he had assumed this identity to hide from the Empire). He's first seen rescuing Luke Skywalker from Tusken Raiders while the boy looks for R2-D2. Obi-Wan presents Luke with Anakin's lightsaber, but when Luke asks Obi-Wan about his father, Obi-Wan disguises the truth from him, saying, ""a young Jedi named Darth Vader... betrayed and murdered your father."" (Obi-Wan reasoned in Return of the Jedi that Anakin Skywalker died the moment he betrayed the Jedi, completely becoming Darth Vader). R2-D2 then plays the message from Princess Leia Organa asking for Obi-Wan's help in delivering the schematics of the Death Star to her foster father on Alderaan. Obi-Wan invites Luke accompany him to Alderaan and aid the Rebellion against the Empire, but Luke initially refuses. However, when Luke discovers that Imperial troopers hunting down the stolen Death Star plans have killed his uncle and aunt and destroyed their home, he changes his mind. Obi-Wan takes young Luke under his wing in order to teach him the ways of the Force with the intention of fully training the boy later on Alderaan.Obi-Wan and Luke buy passage to Alderaan on the Millennium Falcon, a freight ship owned by smuggler Han Solo and co-piloted by Chewbacca, a Wookiee. Before they can reach their destination, however, Alderaan is destroyed by the Death Star on the orders of Grand Moff Tarkin. The Millennium Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam. By a quirk of fate, Princess Leia is on board, and her rescue is gallantly executed by Han and Luke. Obi-Wan, meanwhile, sets off to disable the tractor beam so that the Falcon can escape. Obi-Wan is aware of Vader's presence, and knows he isn't coming back. He deactivates the tractor beam and confronts Vader in a lightsaber duel. At the climactic moment in the duel, after telling Vader ""if you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,"" and just as Luke and the others are making a run for the Falcon, Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down, and his body vanishes as becomes one with the Force. In the ensuing confusion, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice instructing him to ""run, Luke, run!"" and the group makes their escape aboard the Falcon.During the film's climactic battle, Obi-Wan continues to communicate with Luke through the Force, giving him guidance and counsel as Luke destroys the Death Star. The Empire Strikes Back In The Empire Strikes Back, set three years later, Luke is knocked out on the plains of Hoth, and Obi-Wan's force ghost appears telling Luke to go to the Dagobah system for further training with Yoda. After Luke has been trained as a Jedi, Obi-Wan appears in Dagobah to try and dissuade him from going to Cloud City, where Vader holds Han and Leia hostage, as he feels his young apprentice is not yet ready to face Vader one-on-one. After Luke insists on facing Vader, Obi-Wan says sadly that he couldn't help him.Luke is nearly killed in a lightsaber duel with Vader, who reveals to him that he is his father and tries to enlist him into the dark side of the Force. Luke escapes, but is haunted by the truth Obi-Wan withheld from him. Return of the Jedi In Return of the Jedi, set one year later, a dying Yoda confirms to Luke that Vader is indeed his father. After Yoda's death, Obi-Wan appears on Dagobah as a Force Ghost to explain to a heartbroken Luke why he did not tell him the truth about his father, and to confess that Leia was his sister. Obi-Wan admits that his own pride had been partly to blame for Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace: ""I thought I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong."" He then tries to explain to Luke that killing Vader is the only way to destroy the Empire and save the galaxy, even if it means committing patricide.At the end of the film, Obi-Wan's ghost appears alongside the ghosts of fellow Jedi Yoda and a redeemed Anakin on the forest moon of Endor, watching over Luke and his comrades as they celebrate the destruction of the second Death Star and, with it, the Empire.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTg0ODAxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg"

"Princess Leia","Main Biography Leia Organa had accomplished much at a young age: a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic, a former member of the Imperial Senate, and a member of the Royal Family of Alderaan. Yet despite her stature, for many years, Leia herself was not privy to much of her true heritage. It was common knowledge throughout the court that Leia was adopted into the Royal Family. What wasn't common knowledge was that Leia was born to Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi pupil who succumbed to the dark side and became Darth Vader. She was one of a set of twins, born in secrecy and protected from Vader and the Emperor. The Jedi hero and general, Obi-Wan Kenobi, saw to it that Leia was secretly transported to the planet Alderaan, where she was to be raised by Kenobi's friend Bail Organa. The boy, Luke, was taken to the distant world of Tatooine. Leia has few memories of her true mother, Padmé Amidala. All that Leia can recall is that she was beautiful, but sad.Leia followed in her adoptive father's footsteps, and entered politics. She became the youngest senator ever in the Imperial Senate, representing Alderaan. As a senator, Princess Leia ran a number of ""diplomatic aid missions"" that were fronts for Rebel resupply missions. She used her diplomatic immunity and her consular ship to gain access to restricted areas.One such mission saw Leia's ship intercepting vital Imperial plans stolen by Rebel spies. These plans, the complete technical readouts of the Death Star battle station, could be exploited by the Alliance to secure a sizable victory over the Empire. Armed with the Death Star plans, Leia was given a mission by her father to find one of the Republic's greatest heroes and recruit him into the Alliance. En route to the planet Tatooine to find General Obi-Wan Kenobi, Leia's ship was attacked by Imperial forces, and she was taken prisoner by Lord Darth Vader. She barely had time to hide the stolen plans into the memory systems of an R2 unit, and ordered it to find Obi-Wan on Tatooine.As a prisoner of Vader, Leia underwent terrible torture aboard the Death Star. In addition to the mind probes, the Imperials forced her to witness the destruction of her home planet of Alderaan. Despite this, she refused to reveal the location of the hidden Rebel base, or the whereabouts of the stolen plans. Shortly thereafter, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo rescued her from the battle station and carried her and the stolen plans to the Rebel base on Yavin's fourth moon. Due to Leia's efforts, and the help of her companions, the Death Star was eventually destroyed.Three years later, the Alliance had set up a new base on the frozen world of Hoth. Princess Leia was one of the commanding members of Echo Base. When the Imperials attacked Hoth, Leia took the initiative, and acted in a number of command roles, ordering the evacuation of the base. Leia's access to her own escape transport was cut off, but she managed to escape in Han Solo's Millennium Falcon.Evading Imperial pursuit, the Falcon landed in an asteroid field so that its crew could repair the vessel. It was during these quiet moments that Princess Leia Organa fell in love with Han Solo. The two voiced their love on Cloud City of Bespin, where the Imperial forces tracked them. Darth Vader captured Han Solo, and Leia was forced to watch as the Dark Lord froze him in carbonite, and then handed him over to the bounty hunter, Boba Fett. Leia escaped Cloud City with the aid of its administrator, Lando Calrissian.The Rebels eventually tracked down Boba Fett as the bounty hunter delivered Han's carbon-frozen form to Jabba the Hutt. Leia participated in Luke's plan to free the captured Solo from the clutches of the vile gangster. She posed as Boushh, an Ubese bounty hunter and infiltrated the palace, freeing Solo from his carbonite imprisonment. Her identity was revealed, and for a time, she had to endure the humiliation of being made one of Jabba's slaves. She repaid the gangster, however, by strangling the Hutt with the very chain that bound her.Leia rejoined Alliance High Command in time to accompany General Han Solo's strike team on the moon of Endor. Their mission was to destroy the shield generator protecting the second Death Star. While on Endor, Leia became separated from the strike team, and befriended an Ewok tribe. Her diplomatic skills aided in convincing the Ewoks to help the Rebel force. It was shortly thereafter that Luke revealed their true lineage to her. For a time, Luke and Leia kept their true relation and their parentage a secret from all but their most trusted friends.During the ground battle at the Imperial complex, Leia sustained a slight blaster wound. After the victory at Endor, Leia continued to demonstrate some ability in the Force, being able to sense her brother's presence.Leia is a driven, dedicated individual. She has a forceful, some would say abrasive, personality. She is professional in all respects, but occasionally relaxes her guard to let her strong compassion and quirky sense of humor show. Leia is a petite, fair-skinned human female with brown eyes, and long brown hair that she often wears in an elaborate fashion. Expanded Biography Leia was raised in a life of privilege, a stark contrast to her twin brother who grew up on the harsh desert world of Tatooine. Despite this, Leia never grew soft or decadent. Her strong personality and bright intellect molded her into an exceptional person, one that Bail Organa loved and was very proud of. She avoided the vagaries of court politics and intrigue, and instead concentrated on bettering herself and helping others. Leia had a happy childhood, learning in the best institutes on Alderaan, and studying politics, history and art. Leia's interest in art was one of her main reasons for joining the Rebellion. Learning how the Empire controlled expression really cemented her devotion to the Alliance's cause. Leia learned history from one of the greatest professors in the galaxy, Arn Horada. She was taught self-defense and combat skills from Giles Durane, the Weapons Master.When the galaxy plunged into civil war, Leia's diplomacy and martial skills served the Rebel Alliance. On a diplomatic mission to Ralltiir, a world subjugated by the Empire, she discovered a wounded Rebel with information stored in his brain through hypnotic imprint. This Rebel had the news of the Death Star operation. Learning of the abominable weapon, Leia discovered that there was no redeeming the Empire. What was to some an ordered, structured government built on the ashes of a corrupt and ineffective Republic was to Leia a vile villain to be destroyed. One of her first open acts of Rebellion was simply self-defense -- Leia was attacked by Imperial Lord Tion for her Rebel affiliations, and she was forced to take his life.Fully committed to the Alliance cause, Leia's convictions were by no means swayed by the Alderaan tragedy. She continued to serve the Alliance in diplomatic capacities. En route to a conference on Circarpous IV, Luke and Leia crash-landed on the jungle planet Mimban. There, Leia was forced to face Darth Vader during a quest for the legendary Kaiburr Crystal. Leia held off the Dark Lord single-handedly with Luke's lightsaber before Skywalker was able to defeat him. Vader was merely toying with her, scarring her continuously with his deadly blade. Luke used the Kaiburr's healing power to mend Leia's grievous wounds.Leia attended an important Conference of Uncommitted Worlds on the planet Kabal after the Battle of Yavin. There, she recruited the Aquaris Freeholders to the Alliance. The Freeholders proved very resourceful and valuable when the Alliance abandoned Yavin as their base. During the Alliance relocation, Leia was able to access lost Organa resources of money and capital on Ord Mantell greatly needed for the Rebel war effort. Leia's efforts were also felt in the distant Minos Cluster, where she helped unify Rebellion against the Empire.In the months that followed the Battle of Hoth, Leia felt torn between her duties to the Rebellion and her devotion to Han. Although she and her friends continued their search for Boba Fett, she still had Alliance missions to undertake. In her devoted search for Solo, Leia found herself drawn into the underworld of Black Sun, a vast criminal syndicate that permeated the entire galaxy. There, she was almost seduced by Prince Xizor, the ruler of the organization. His handsome features and irresistible pheromones nearly wooed Leia to his side, but she overcame his temptation.After the Battle of Endor, Leia went on a number of diplomatic missions on behalf of the newly founded Alliance of Free Planets. When the New Republic replaced the interim government, Leia was one of the inner council members that helped shape its growth.Four years into the New Republic's rule, the normally isolationist government of the Hapes Consortium began making entreaties. The Hapan Prince Isolder proposed marriage to Leia, offering the vast wealth of the Hapes Cluster to the Republic in exchange for her hand. Han Solo would have none of it. In a characteristically brash and reckless move, Han kidnapped Leia and stole away to Dathomir, a world he won in an incredible game of sabacc. Though Solo was an expert at marksmanship, piloting and smuggling, his idea of the ""romantic"" could have definitely used some work. Despite eloping to a world full of evil Force-weilding witches and an Imperial garrison, Leia's heart still chose the scruffy-looking scoundrel over the dashing prince, and Han and Leia were married shortly thereafter.Now known as Leia Organa Solo and the New Republic Minister of State, she set out on her most challenging role: that of mother. Leia gave birth to twins, Jacen and Jaina, during one of the New Republic's most trying times. Against a backdrop of war unleashed by Imperial warlord Grand Admiral Thrawn, Leia delivered two healthy and very Force-sensitive babies. A year-and-a-half later, she had a third child, Anakin.When Mon Mothma stepped down from her position of Chief of State of the New Republic due to health issues, she passed on the mantle of leadership to Leia. Organa Solo ruled for several years, guiding the Republic through numerous crises as the government experienced growing pains.Though Leia stepped away from public office, she still remained a valuable member of the New Republic hierarchy. Her relief efforts during theYuuzhan Vong crisis are well known. The mother of full-grown Jedi Knights, Leia still brandishes her lightsaber and Jedi heritage, though she readily admits regret that her political career had interfered with her early Jedi training.Her connection to the Force helped her weather the trying times of the Yuuzhan Vong crisis. Leia struggled to keep her family together during the invasion, becoming the emotional anchor when the tragic death of Chewbacca deeply affected Han. Grief-stricken, Solo withdrew from his commitments as father and husband.Following a near-death experience on Duro, Leia and Han were reunited, and bolstered each other's strength, renewing their commitment and faith in their love. Such strength was vital, for more bloodshed was to scatter the Solo family. Leia's headstrong son, Anakin, died in a heroic mission into Yuuzhan Vong territory. The pain and anguish of that loss echoed through the Force, crippling Leia with despair.Yet she did not lose all hope. Her remaining two children also felt the loss of Anakin. Jacen was held captive by the Yuuzhan Vong, and most in the New Republic believed him dead. But Leia held onto her adamant belief that Jacen was still alive, even though he seemed undetectable through the Force. Jaina plunged herself into her dangerous career as a starfighter pilot, leading foolhardy sorties against the Yuuzhan Vong. The young pilot worked hard to build walls around her emotions, and even excluded her mother from her war-weary heart for a time. The two were eventually able to settle their differences.After months of uncertainty, the remnants of the Solo family were finally reunited as the fragments of the New Republic consolidated its push against the Yuuzhan Vong. While Leia stayed clear of any official involvement in the newly formed Galactic Alliance government, she continued her service as a skilled diplomat, flying missions into territories that had lost contact with the rest of the galaxy during the invasion, and attempting to weave together the fragments torn apart by the Yuuzhan Vong.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzM4NzkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyMTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg"

He had dealings with the Resistance X-Wing pilot Poe Dameron and his droid BB-8 and kept a piece of the map to find Luke Skywalker. They were located by the First Order shortly after giving the map to Dameron, who hid it inside BB-8. San Tekka watched helplessly as he saw his hometown being burned down. Dameron was captured and BB-8 fled, while San Tekka was confronted by Kylo Ren, who killed him with his lightsaber after a short conversation in which he attempted to find the whereabouts of Poe Dameron, as well as San Tekka trying to reason with him because of Ren's family history.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BN2QxODliZGYtMmVjMS00MTFiLWJkYTItYjRjM2JiOTVhMDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk3NTUyOTc@._V1_.jpg"

"Yoda"," The Phantom Menace In the timeline of the films, Yoda first appears in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. In that film, Qui-Gon brings the young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council, claiming that the boy is the ""Chosen One"" who will bring balance to the Force, and requests to train him once Obi-Wan has completed the trials necessary to become a Jedi Knight. As told to young Anakin Skywalker, "" Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering..' Yoda plays a key role in that body's initial decision to deny the request; he believes that the boy is clearly affected by his years as a slave, and that he still clings too tightly to the memory of his mother to be trained safely. Yoda thinks his future is clouded.After Qui-Gon's death at the hands of Darth Maul, however, the Jedi Council rescinds their previous decision, despite Yoda's misgivings.  Attack of the Clones In Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, set 10 years later, Yoda is a key Republic general at the Battle of Geonosis, when the clone trooper Army of the Republic is first deployed. He leads the group which rescues Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala from execution at the hands of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, aka the Separatists. At the climax of the battle, Yoda duels with Separatist leader and Sith Lord Count Dooku, who was once Yoda's Jedi apprentice. This confrontation ends with Dooku making his escape by threatening Yoda's injured comrades, Anakin and Obi-Wan. Although seemingly frail, the ancient Yoda demonstrates a legendary agility and mastery of lightsaber combat and acrobatics.  Clone Wars During the Clone Wars micro series Yoda is made a General like many of the Jedi Knights and Masters. Yoda escorts Padmé on their journey to a planet but Yoda senses several Jedi in distress on Illum and uses the Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them there. Yoda saves the two Jedi and finds a message of Dooku giving the orders to destroy the Jedi Temple.As the Clone Wars progress Yoda fights alongside Mace Windu in the Battle of Coruscant and is the one who tries to understand with Master Windu the logic behind the Sepratists massive attack on the Republic Capital. The two Jedi Masters realize that this is a distraction for Grievous to kidnap the Chancellor. Windu goes onto a Clone Hanger to try and prevent the kidnapping.  Revenge of the Sith In Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, Yoda leads the Jedi Council in seeking out the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Yoda uses his incredible sensitivity and power with the Force to sense the Sith Lord's presence, finally concluding that Sidious is someone within Supreme Chancellor Palpatine's inner circle. Palpatine himself sidetracks the mission, however; by now, the Chancellor has amassed near-absolute power in the Galactic Senate, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs. He appoints Anakin as his personal representative on the Council, which would effectively grant the headstrong young man the rank of Jedi Master. The Council denies Anakin the promotion, however, fearing that giving Palpatine's representative the rank of Master would be the same as giving Palpatine himself a vote in the Council. Embittered by the perceived snub, Anakin begins to lose faith in the Jedi.Earlier, Anakin seeks Yoda's counsel about his intense, prophetic visions that someone close to him will die (he does not tell the Jedi Master that the ""someone"" is Padmé, now his secret wife and pregnant with his child; emotional attachments are forbidden by the Jedi Code.) Yoda, unaware of the intensity of Anakin's love for Padmé, tells him to ""Train yourself to let go... of everything you fear to lose."" Unsatisfied, Anakin instead turns to Palpatine, who reveals himself as none other than Darth Sidious, and manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his Sith apprentice Darth Vader with the promise that, with powers only the dark side can give, he can save his wife.When Palpatine, now self-appointed Emperor of the Galactic Empire, implements Order 66, Yoda is on Kashyyyk, overseeing the battle between the Separatist forces and a combined command of clone troopers and Wookiees. Through the Force, he feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are cut down by the very troops they commanded. He swiftly kills the clone troopers sent to dispatch him, escapes with the help of Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca, and returns to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple to stop a trap for any Jedi who also survived Order 66. Upon discovering a holographic recording revealing Anakin as the assassin, Yoda sends Obi-Wan to kill his former Padawan. Obi-Wan tells Yoda he cannot fight Anakin, but Yoda insists, saying, ""To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough you are not."" Subsequently, Yoda battles Palpatine in a titanic struggle that wrecks the Senate building. The fight seems evenly matched between the two patriarchs of both sides of the Force, neither able to overcome the other. Unable to defeat the Sith Lord, Yoda is forced to retreat and go into exile so that he may hide from the Empire and wait for another opportunity to destroy the Sith.Meanwhile, Anakin is defeated by Obi-Wan, losing his limbs and nearly burning to death. The cybernetic enhancements Palpatine administers to save his life render him (seemingly) less than human. His transformation into a fearsome cyborg serves as a grim fulfillment to Yoda's words to Obi-Wan upon learning of Anakin's fall from grace: ""The boy you trained, gone he is, consumed by Darth Vader.""At the end, it is revealed that Yoda has been in contact with Qui-Gon's spirit. Although this is given little attention in the film, the novelization revealed that Yoda actually becomes Padawan to the deceased Jedi Master's Force ghost, learning the secret of immortality from him and passing it on to Obi-Wan.Yoda is also instrumental in deciding the fate of the Skywalker children after Padmé dies in childbirth, recommending that Luke and Leia be hidden from Darth Vader and Palpatine in remote locations. Other than the ancient Jedi Master, only the Organas, the Lars, and Obi-Wan know of their placement. Originally, Obi-Wan wants to have both Yoda and himself take one child each to separate spots and train the children in the ways of the Force, but Yoda realizes that there are other ways to learn discipline than just Jedi training, and that Luke and Leia will need to be trained differently if they are going to defeat the Empire. In addition, the twins' anonymity would be more difficult to protect if the Sith were to discover the remaining Jedi Knights before Luke and/or Leia were ready. Yoda then retreats to Dagobah.  The Empire Strikes Back In Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, set 22 years after Revenge of the Sith, Luke Skywalker arrives on Dagobah to seek Yoda's guidance. This happens after Luke is instructed to do so, by the Force-ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Obi-Wan had sacrificed himself in a duel with Vader in A New Hope).This is Yoda's first appearance, the most beloved and best-remembered of all. Yoda's appearance was based on Freeborn, but Freeborn gave the design eyes based on Albert Einstein's. The puppet was fully operated by Frank Oz, with two technical assistants guiding him on the soundstage.After initial reluctance, Yoda agrees to teach Luke in the ways of the Force. Prior to finishing his training, however, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah in order to confront Darth Vader and save his friends from the Empire's grasp at Bespin. Yoda insists to Luke that he is being lured into a trap, and that he must stay to complete his training. However, Luke cannot forsake his friends who are in danger. He promises to return to complete his training.  Return of the Jedi Yoda's final chronological appearance is in Return of the Jedi, set a year later. Yoda, sick and greatly weakened by old age, informs Luke that he has completed his training but will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader; he also confirms that Vader is Luke's father, which the Sith Lord had told a shocked Luke in the previous film. Yoda then dies at the age of 900 and becomes ""one with the Force."" He leaves Luke with the knowledge that ""there is another Skywalker."" Moments later, Obi-Wan's Force ghost helps Luke come to the realization that the sibling Yoda spoke of is none other than Leia. When the Emperor tries to kill Luke with Force lightning, Vader redeems himself and once again becomes Anakin Skywalker. By killing his master to save his son, he fulfills the prophecy and brings balance to the Force. Anakin dies in his son's arms as the Death Star crumbles around them. Later that night, Luke sees his father's spirit looking at him with pride and gratitude, in the company of Obi-Wan Kenobi and their once and future master, Yoda.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNDIwNjM4Nzk0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDcxMTY2Mw@@._V1_.jpg"
"C-3PO","C-3PO, also spelled See-Threepio, also called Threepio for short, was a protocol droid specifically designed to interact with organics. C-3PO's TranLang III Communicator module combined with his AA-1 VerboBrain allowed him to be fluent in over six million forms of communication. He was also equipped with over thirty secondary functions. C-3PO was generally seen with his counterpart, R2-D2, a small, wheeled R2-series astromech droid. C-3PO's main function as a protocol droid was to assist with etiquette, customs, and translation so that meetings of different cultures ran smoothly. In his time, C-3PO loyally served over forty masters. He hated adventure and space travel, as they often resulted in him coming out on the wrong end of a fight, losing parts, and having them reattached, sometimes incorrectly. Together with R2-D2, C-3PO played a pivotal role in galactic history, however lowly he may have thought of himself.In 2004, C-3PO was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame, joining R2-D2, which had been inducted the previous year.

"Kylo Ren","Kylo Ren is the primary antagonist in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens.Behind the ScenesEarly iterations of Kylo Ren's character design portrayed him as a cyborg who had multiple cybernetic implants to replace parts of his face, arms, and overall body. This style was scrapped in favor of a style reminiscent of Darth Vader's armor, as to highlight Ren's obsession with the Dark Lord.Kylo Ren's look went through various phases during production. In his earliest incarnation, he was an alien with one red eye, and wielded a lightsaber with a Wampa bone for a hilt. Later in production, he was a cyborg, with metal parts covering his face and arms. His final design shows him as human, but he wears a mask heavily reminiscent of Darth Vader's mask, as to reflect his obsession with the Sith Lord....PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOW...Kylo Ren is revealed early in Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens to be Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo and Leia Organa. It is implied that he was trained by Luke Skywalker and turned to the dark side after being seduced to it by Supreme Leader Snoke, causing Skywalker to go into hiding from the defeat of losing his nephew to the dark side.Kylo Ren is consumed by his need to emulate and eclipse the legacy of his Sith Lord grandfather, Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. He appears to be conflicted with his dark powers, succumbing to fits of rage and uncertainty about his decisions. This uncertainty culminates in a confrontation with his father, Han Solo.Han Solo attempts to bring Kylo 'home' and return him to the light side of the force, and appears to succeed when Kylo reveals his internal suffering and gestures to hand over his lightsaber. However, Kylo's surrender is overpowered by the darkness in him and he lashes out against Solo, resulting in his father's death.Ren is gravely injured following the battle of Starkiller Base, having sustained several injuries at the hands of Chewbacca, Finn and Rey. Snoke orders General Hux of the First Order to recover Ren's body, so that his training may be completed.","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTgwNTEwNDkwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQzMTY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"
"Luke Skywalker","Name: Luke SkywalkerStatus: AliveBorn: 19 BBYHeight: 5' 8"" (1.73 m)He is born to Padmé Amidala, moments before his twin sister, Leia. His mother dies in childbirth. Jedi Masters Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi hide the children to prevent the newly declared Galactic Empire and its ruler, Palpatine, using them to gain greater control over the galaxy. Leia would go to Alderaan and grow up a princess, the adopted daughter of Senator Bail Organa, and Luke would be taken to the desert planet of Tatooine to be raised as a moisture farmer by his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru. Obi-Wan would then go into exile on Tatooine to keep an eye on Luke during his formative years.19 years later, Luke lives a humdrum existence on Tatooine with his aunt and uncle, who have kept his father's true history a secret from him. He makes his first steps toward his destiny when he finds two droids, C-3PO and R2-D2; he meets Obi-Wan, whom he knows as the eccentric hermit ""Ben Kenobi"", for whom a message in R2-D2's memory system is intended. Obi-Wan tells him that his father was a Jedi, killed by Darth Vader. He then presents Luke with his father's lightsaber. Obi-Wan offers to take Luke to Alderaan, but Luke rejects his offer.Luke changes his mind when he discovers his aunt and uncle were killed by the Storm Troopers who were hunting down C-3PO & R2-D2. They catch a ride with the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on their ship, the Millennium Falcon, only to find that Alderaan has been destroyed by the Empire's new superweapon, the Death Star.The group sneaks onto the Death Star and rescues a captive Princess Leia; in the process, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a duel with Vader. Luke is heartbroken, but finds the strength (with help from Obi-Wan's spirit) to join the Rebel Alliance and destroy the Death Star.Three years later, Luke is a commander in the Rebel Alliance. While on a mission on the ice planet Hoth, he is nearly killed by a Wampa; he escapes with the help of the Force and his lightsaber. In the frozen wasteland, he sees the spirit of Obi-Wan, who tells him to travel to the planet Dagobah and complete his training under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo then saves Luke from freezing to death, having rode out into the night to do so.When the Empire discovers the Rebel base on Hoth, Luke leads a snowspeeder squadron to cover the evacuation. Escaping Hoth in his X-wing, he travels to Dagobah, rather than regrouping with the Alliance. There, he meets Yoda and undergoes rigorous Jedi training, increasing his power in the Force.His training is interrupted by a vision of his friends in pain. Against Obi-Wan and Yoda's advice, he travels to Cloud City to save them, only to be lured into a lightsaber duel with Darth Vader. As his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for the powerful and experienced Vader. After losing his right hand, he learns the truth: Darth Vader is his father. Vader offers him the chance to turn to the dark side of the Force and rule the galaxy at his father's side. Horrified, Luke chooses to die rather than be corrupted and throws himself into a deep reactor chasm. However, he is sucked into a garbage chute to the underside of Cloud City and left hanging onto a weather vane. Leia, flying away from Cloud City in the Millennium Falcon, senses Luke's peril and turns the ship around to save him. Aboard the medical ship after rejoining the rebel fleet, Luke's missing hand is replaced with a robotic one.Luke, along with Leia, the droids, and Lando Calrissian, save Han Solo from the gangster Jabba the Hutt, who had acquired the carbonite-encased Solo after the events in the Cloud City. Luke offers to negotiate with Jabba, but instead is forced to fight a fearsome monster, the Rancor. When Luke kills it, Jabba sentences him to be thrown into a The Pit of Karcoon, to be eaten by the Sarlacc. Luke escapes with R2's help, saving his friends and destroying Jabba's barge. We also learn Luke has constructed a new green lightsaber. During the Battle of Endor, Vader confronts Luke in an attempt to turn him to the dark side.During his return trip to Dagobah, Luke learns from the dying Yoda that Vader is indeed his father, and from Obi-Wan's spirit that Leia is his twin sister. Yoda tells Luke that he will not truly be a Jedi until he confronts his father. Luke insists that there is still good left in Vader, and pledges to bring him back from the dark side.Arriving on Endor as part of a Rebel commando squad, Luke surrenders to Vader in an attempt to bring the Dark Lord back to the light side of the Force. He ultimately becomes a prisoner of the Emperor on the second Death Star, in orbit around Endor.The Emperor and Vader attempt to turn Luke to the dark side with promises to save his friends from certain death. When that fails, the Emperor goads Luke to strike him down to save the Rebels, who are losing the Battle of Endor. Luke momentarily lashes out, but Vader blocks his strike, and father and son face each other in a final duel. Luke tries to keep his emotions under control until Vader senses the existence of Luke's sister and threatens to turn her instead. Enraged, Luke attacks with full fury. Vader loses ground as Luke lands blow after blow; Luke eventually forces Vader on his back and severs his father's mechanical right arm. With The Emperor ordering Luke to strike Vader down to take his place, Luke glances at his own bionic hand and realizes with a visceral horror that he's on the verge of suffering his father's fate. Luke regains control, deactivates his lightsaber and emphatically throws it away, passing Yoda's final test and proudly declaring his allegiance to the Jedi.The Emperor uses Force lightning against Luke in retaliation, nearly killing him. In horrible pain, Luke calls out to his father for help. In an act of self-sacrifice, Vader seizes the Emperor and throws him to his death down a reactor shaft. In the process, Vader is mortally wounded. On the deteriorating Death Star, Luke (at his father's request) removes the mask that had encased Anakin Skywalker's face, and looks upon his father's eyes for the first and only time. Anakin dies moments later, assuring his son that there is still good in him after all. Luke escapes with his father's remains. On Endor, in the manner of a Jedi's funeral, Luke burns the last vestiges of his father that had been Darth Vader. During the Rebel Alliance's victory celebrations on Endor, Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan, Yoda, and his father...","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0Mjg3NzEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAyMzA4NA@@._V1_.jpg"

"R2-D2 Consultant","R2-D2, phonetically spelled Artoo-Detoo or Artoo, was an astromech droid and undoubtedly the most famous unit of the R2 series. A longtime friend and counterpart of the protocol droid C-3PO, he served the Skywalker family faithfully for many years. Along with his resourcefulness, R2-D2 was equipped by his original owners, the Royal House of Naboo and the Royal Naboo Starfighter Corps, with many tool-tipped appendages that allowed him to serve as a superior starship mechanic and computer interface specialist. A bold droid in personality and temperament, R2-D2 would often enter dangerous situations without second thought in order to give aid to his masters. This adventurous streak served his companions well on numerous occasions, often turning the tide of galactic history.R2-D2 was a diminutive droid, standing 0.96 meters tall. He rolled on three legs, one could retract into his body, and had a silver and blue domed head. His white, blue, and silver body housed many arms, sensors, and other apparatuses, many of which were not readily seen by the typical humanoid eye. This often made the droid seem like a box of tricks, unexpectedly pulling out some previously unseen but much needed device at a critical moment.While R2-D2 contained many specialized gadgets, he was also quite good at taking the initiative and often employed unorthodox means to help his friends.In 2003, R2-D2 was in the inaugural class inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame. See: http://www.robothalloffame.org/inductees/03inductees/r2d2.html.The May 2014 issue of Smithsonian magazine, pp. 68-69, has an article by Clive Thompson titled ""Almost Human: How R2-D2 became the most beloved robot in the galaxy"".","http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5MTc3MTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIyMTIyMw@@._V1_.jpg"
